Our mission is more than to provide a professional soccer playing environment with fun and excitement. Our vision is to become a platform for making the world a better place. In order to do that we are donating 10% of every league fee, camp, tournament, and ad sponsorship. But instead of trying to get our customers excited about causes we are passionate about, we are going to become passionate about the causes they already care about. That is why we are letting our customers choose what cause they want their 10% to support. So we???ve decided to stand for action rather than any particular cause. We want to have fun and give back to our world. We believe that the best feeling in the world is the joy of giving and we want to give that gift to our customers. We want to create a community around giving and goodwill. We invite you to be part of our vision and community by becoming an investor today. Financial: Our monthly expenses are less than $2,000 including rent, insurance, utilities, etc. Each league we run will generate $2,500 each month. We plan to start with three leagues this December. We will also run soccer camps, rent out the field, and sell ad sponsorship packages in the arena to generate additional income. Construction Status: We have installed over 17,000 square feet of artificial turf. All permits are completed and approved. We???re ready to install the dasher boards.

I've been using cash/debit almost exclusively since January but recently realized that I can't continue the trend without consolidating my debt. For the past couple of days, this problem has honestly been the 1st haunting thought that comes to mind when I wake up.  I always pay my bills, I have over $2,000 in savings to take care of any mis-haps or unexpected expenses which helps. I'm getting older and, as a result, tired of this non-sense - no more credit card debt! I've now controlled my impulse shopping habit (I work in retail, so that is very hard to do!) and I actually feel comfortable saying ""no"" or ""I can't afford that"" when asked to go places or do things.

My significant other was hospitalized last year and had to have major surgery to keep him from going paralyzed. He has been unemployed for the past year and a half due to his surgery. All of my income has had to go to our mortgage and bills. Due to this I have reached the limit on all of my credit cards. I purposely have kept my limits low, so my total debt is not too significant. I would like to be able to pay off these high interest rate cards and finally be able to gain some ground. My significant other is now employed and we both want nothing more than to start paying off our debt. I have been with my wonderful employer for over 2 years and have been consistently employed since the age of 18. It is high time I start using my money wisely, but will never be able to do so until I can pay down my debt. This seems like a wonderful program and I would love to be able to be able to turn around and invest when I can financially do so.  Thank you for your consideration. You have no idea how much this would impact my day to day life as well as my future.

I have already scouted a location and employees and put a down payment on the real estate, all I need now is the start-up money. I have a very simple business model that I took from a very successful dumpling shop in New York City's chinatown where I grew up. I have a great recipe and will be selling 5 dumplings for 2 dollars, they will cost me about 10 cents each to make so I expect to see a very high profit margin. My pre-approved quote said I could get a $10,500 loan with payments of $335.45 per month. My housing expenses are paid for by my parents and they give me $1600 per month on top of that. I tend to spend about 600 per month on food and the rest is disposable income, so even if my business were to fail I would still have enough money coming in to make my loan payments.

The first business line is a residential/commercial tree, landscaping and lawn service.  The second line of business, sells the raw materials acquired by the first line; namely wood fuel, mulch, firewood and also accepts green waste from individual consumers as well as cities and municipalities.   You can visit our website at Braikbrothers.com to learn more about our company. We have been growing rapidly but, have found it difficult to access working capital by conventional measures so, decided to give this a try.   I have worked in financial services for the past 13 years.  I own a significant amount of residential and rural real estate with an average LTV of approximately 60%.  My largest real estate holding is 365acres in rural central MO.  The property is appraised at roughly $1.1MM (w/a $650k mortgage).  Most local lenders are not willing to increase the LTV on this loan with cash out above 65%.  My brother was the Controller/CFO of a family owned tree service in St. Louis for 6 years.  During this time he gained an enormous amount of practical, hands on experience into how a successful tree service should be run.  We have two certified arborists on staff.  One of which is eligible to sit for the Master Arborist certification which requires being a certified arborist for at least 6 years.  We have grown from 3 full-time employees when we officially began offering services in September of last year and given the demand for our services in Columbia and St. Louis, MO, currently employ 10 full-time employees.  With my brother heading up the day-to-day operations, a professional and well-trained staff to complete the work and my ability to provide personal capital and access to further financing I am very bullish on the prospects for our business.    As with any new business access to working capital is a key ingredient to success and I am excited by the opportunities this site may provide.  I can be contacted via email (jsbraik@yahoo.com) at any time should you require additional information.

I have a B.S. in Engineering and have been working within my degree since I graduated college in May 2005. I am successful in what I do and have been a salaried employed by the same company (minus a 5 month hiatus where I quit to work for another company) since I graduated. As a note, my company was more than willing to take me back, thank goodness.   My situation is probably not unique from many other people's however one thing that is unique about me is that I respect and fulfill every debt that I have incurred. I have never had negative comments on my credit report and do whatever it takes to fulfill my obligations including taking second jobs and working as much as 100 hours a week or more.   So you are probably wondering how I got to the point where I am writing this asking for a loan to pay off credit cards. When I married my wife she had a 2 year old son. At that point I had two years of college left. Within these two years, my stepson's father dragged us into court 4 times. Since college he has dragged us into court 2 more times. Attorney's fees stacked up fast and during college we had no other option. Either pay cash and be forced to live on credit or visa versa. Needless to say by the time I graduated and started my career we were already way behind the financial 8-ball and have not been able to recuperate.    I feel probably like most, that there is no way out and no light at the end of the tunnel. I will not try a counseling scam and until now I had no knowledge of peer-to-per lending. I think the concept is brilliant. Why not help others that are willing to help you. Its a win win situation.   I don't feel I have been irresponsible with my credit. I don't have ""toys"", expensive electronics (I salvaged our TV from my neighbors trash), or even go on vacation. Regardless, its to the point now where I need to see a light at the end of the tunnel. If I can see a date on a calendar where I know the debt will be gone that would be a great relief to me and my marriage.  When I was growing up, the one thing I swore to myself was that I was going to be financially stable for my kids. I wanted them to grow up without worrying about money as I did. Not that my kids are old enough to worry about that now but if this continues I know I will fail.  Whether or not you contribute to my loan request thank you for taking the time to read my note.

I am currently preparing for my wedding which will be in late August. The majority of the expenses are being covered by family -I am looking to obtain a loan for 15k to cover a portion of the wedding as well as consolidate debt already accrued from expenses.   In regards to my own background, I have a stable job and have not ever had any late payments or delinquencies on my credit. I make all my payments on time and will continue to do so if provided with this loan.  Furthermore, I am also living with and taking care of my parents in their home which is paid off so I do not have a mortgage payment to make. Following our wedding, my fiance and I plan to remain at my parents' home for at least 6-9 months while we save up money to look into buying our own home.  This is my financial history:  I have two credit cards currently carrying balances of approximately 4300 and 1500 with interest rates of 18% and 13%. Much of this debt has been accrued from wedding expenses (i.e. invitations, bills for catering, etc.). I have been making monthly payments of at least  $400 on the higher balance card while I have been paying about $60-80 on the lower balance card.  My goal with this loan would be to consolidate my debt into one monthly, low interest payment.  Overall, I am good candidate for this loan because I make all my payments, I understand the importance of good credit (looking for a home so I know what big difference minor fluctuations in the credit score can entail). Thank you for your time and God bless.

I am very lucky because my husband is a very hard worker and has been able to bring us to a better place.  He has always put us first, and being that we have three children, he has put them and their interest first for so long.  Since we got married so young, we were unable to buy a nice wedding ring set for either one of us, and now that we have been together for over 10years, he really wants to buy me a nice wedding ring set.

I have a very loyal client following, enjoy my work very much and plan to continue working in my current capacity until I retire.  I take my financial responsibilities seriously and have never defaulted on a loan.<br/><br/>I purchased a foreclosed property this past summer.  The property is a fenced acre with a double wide manufactured home on it.  Manufactured homes are very common in this part of the country.  The well and septic system were inspected prior to purchase and found to be in good condition but the home itself is in need of repair.  The property was initially purchased with the intention of selling the manufactured home and purchasing a modular home to be installed on the property.  At the same time I had the home I am currently living in on the real estate market.  My intention was to sell my home and use the proceeds to pay off debt and have cash on hand for emergencies.  By doing this and moving into a less expensive modular home (on the foreclosed property) I would be reducing my monthly mortgage payment as well as my total mortgage debt amount substantially.<br/><br/>I had a buyer lined up for the manufactured home but shortly before he purchased it there was a death in his family and he could no longer proceed with the purchase..... more to follow<br/> Borrower added on 11/04/10 > ...I began to feel that a new opportunity was presenting itself.  My current mortgage on that property is below $300. per month.  The mortgage is a land loan so I actually own the manufactured home outright.  If my husband and I were able to renovate the manufactured home ourselves we would be living in a nice home on a desirable piece of land for a very small monthly mortgage.  Really when you think about it, less than $300. per month is almost like living for free.  The renovation loan would be paid off relatively quickly (as compared with a mortgage) so in a few years our only debt would be a small mortgage and possibly a car payment.<br/><br/>I am a conservative spender.  In spite of this I have credit card debt.  My goal is to pay it off with the sale of my current house.  The reason for much of that debt is twofold.  My husband has had many health problems.  The cost of medical procedures and medications has been significant.  In addition, it has also resulted in gaps in his employment that have obviously resulted in less income.  He was also laid off from his job about 8 months ago after a massive downsizing (aobut 80% of his coworkers lost their jobs) in his department.  His health has improved greatly over the last few months and he has returned to school and is due to graduate in about 2 months.  I expect he will earn a reasonable salary once he graduates.  He has had 2 different employers approach him about a job after he graduates.<br/>",home_improvement,redneck repair,870xx,NM,12.86,1.0,Nov-1998,0.0,10.0,0.0,13815,22.6,32.0,0.0,Individual,0.0,0.0,Cash,0,0.3389921209219577,0.2998525234882649,0.3679922391195708,0.382796660257403,0.4982741835055009,0.3426523113969785,0.5816326530612245,0.2564285714285714,0.6051785714285715,0.17691326530612245,0.2614,0.727225,0.18442499999999998,0.41527500000000006,0.32470376089203823,0.3380050505050504,0.6901515151515151,0.4049242424242424,0.5953282828282829,0.4727272727272727,0.28325,0.594625,0.27799999999999997,0.507375,0.20202087368827507,0.29275,0.7635,0.25775000000000003,0.4875,0.38199999999999995

These are some of the changes that I've made recently:<br/>-Downgraded rent from $1,390.00 a month to $550.00.<br/>-Gotten rid of my car and now commute via mass transit to my job<br/>-Now have roommates, so monthly utility fees + cable and internet have been cut by a third<br/>-Downgraded phone plans, saving $60/month.<br/>-Created a personal budget of $600 a month for food and entertainment.  I have adhered to this budget (which as it turns out is ample) successfully for the last five months.<br/>-Received a promotion from Tier 2 to Tier 3 Project Manager, and received a salary increase from $46,005.00 annually to $50,500.00 annually.<br/><br/>I began my debt clearance crusade about six months ago, but decided that in order to create more stability in my life, I need to be able to build my savings simultaneously.  Additionally, eliminating the pesky revolving debt would be useful.  <br/><br/>My plan is to save up four months savings and then escalate my effort to pay back my loan.  I'm hoping to accomplish this in two to four years.  I want to be completely transparent with my partners who will be making a significant investment in my future.  If you have any questions, I actively encourage you to ask.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Cleaning Up,024xx,MA,15.52,0.0,Mar-2003,0.0,5.0,0.0,4477,74.6,10.0,0.0,Individual,0.0,0.0,Cash,0,0.4960647862527868,0.5765836398382601,0.510124127884001,0.5693520992543624,0.4965911370375906,0.3275843991277385,0.5816326530612245,0.2564285714285714,0.6051785714285715,0.17691326530612245,0.2614,0.727225,0.18442499999999998,0.41527500000000006,0.3245955496168458,0.3380050505050504,0.6901515151515151,0.4049242424242424,0.5953282828282829,0.4727272727272727,0.28325,0.594625,0.27799999999999997,0.507375,0.20033077604599578,0.29275,0.7635,0.25775000000000003,0.4875,0.38199999999999995

Hello my friends and community members!  First of all I would like to thank you in reading my request and opportunity.  My family and I run/own a small restaurant in Minnesota.  We are currently looking to expand our business within the metro area.  When we first started out my family took out several high interest credit cards and loans to pay for our business expenses.  We now are a fairly successful restaurant, but personally we need this loan because it is affecting my entire families ability to pay our bills.  We will use this loan to pay off all of the high interest credit card bills so we can concentrate more on making money and building the company.  We could definatley use your help.  Thank you.    My financial situation: (explain why you are a good candidate for paying back this loan) I feel that I am a good candidate of paying back this loan because I have experience, integrity, and the innovation in not only helping repay my investors but most importantly putting the food on the table for my family.  My wife and kids are my life and without them I would be nothing.  I have not been late on a loan or missed a payment for 7 years since I first entered college!  Combined with my 8 years in the services industry and being a top rated business man throughout my years, I feel that I am a great candidate for this loan.  I really need to help pay off these debts and especially for the ones that I love, and with the power of that love, and YOUR HELP, we will enable the opportunity save money, pay off our debts, and setup a plan to place my children through college.

I'm am currently shooting two feature length independent films.  These films are not being shot on High Definition, but all subsequent films will need to be.  Therefore, I must upgrade my camera to HD, as well. The camera I've chosen allows for interchangeable lenses.  Having this camera will bring me more assignments due to the camera's versatility, ability to shoot using cinemagraphic lenses and my practical experience with the feature films that I have worked on already.   I base this on the fact that I noted an increase in business when I upgraded in 2005 to a camera that was capable of shooting 23.98 frames-per-second.     Being able to offer shooting-plus-editing packages to clients at reasonable rates is a strength in the current economic environment.  After eight years of experience in my field, the projects of my client base are growing, becoming longer and more involved.  I've gone from 10-20 minute projects (documentary, promo's, PSA's, ads, music videos) to feature length indie film and DVD projects. These projects require more processing speed and hard drive space than the Mac G4 I've been using can handle.  I am able to pull together funding on my own to upgrade my computer, which will allow me handle more than one large project at once, and to author DVD's for my clients from the projects I edit-- better and more efficient for my clients, and more income per project for me ($1000-3000 more per project.)  I work with a diverse mixture of clients -- from educational institutes to documentary producers, up-and-coming African directors, small businesses, corporate clients, production companies, rappers, rockers and other entertainers-- and have built my business using much of the same gear and software I bought will still in school.

I teach music at my wife's school for autism, Celebrate the Children and also work as a recording engineer. I have a steady income. We recently adopted siblings from Kazakhstan (brother and sister). I have been diagnosed with bilateral osteo necrosis of the hip joints. This means that the blood supply to the tips of my femurs was somehow compromised and has left me with lesions of dead bone. Traditional medicine would have me wait until this dead bone collapses and then get  hip replacements. Since the replacements are only good for 5 -7 years, I would have to have this done multiple times, if I live a long life. Last fall I had an ""experimental"" procedure performed on my right hip. The procedure involves drawing my bone marrow and blood, and from that my own stem cells are harvested. Then these stem cells are re-injected into the problem area of the bone to promote re-growth or at least halt the degeneration. This was done by Dr Centeno at the Regenexx clinic in CO. It seems to have been successful. I now need to have this done on my left hip. The procedure cost $8000 and I only have $4000. I have been turned down by my bank and we spent most of our savings on our adoption process. I am experiencing quite a bit of pain and have scheduled the procedure for July- hoping I can raise the money.

I withdrew most of the funds from my brokerage account 3 years ago to pay off a credit card, and to assist a friend in getting rid of some of her inefficient debt a well.  I have since been recompensed over time (charged her no interest).  My mortgage debt is structured very efficiently.  5.0% fixed 30 year mortgage, 5.24% (prime minus 1.26% variable) HELOC.  I traded profitably for 3 years, and never blew up my account.  Only one of my 3 years showed a net loss (very small one at that) and the other two showed moderate profits.  The technicals -------------------- - My credit score, according to Transunion (Dec 8, 2007) is 784.  - I have a home - Bank owns 80%, I own 20% in equity so far, and I'm gaining on them!  Unlike some poor folks who are now upside down in their mortgages I bought in 2002 and have seen handsome appreciation in my area, despite sub-prime crisis.  I've felt the effects but its not as pronounced here. - I am 37, professional software engineer at a Chicago software company - I traded part time for 3 years, and intend to continue this endeavor once I am fully capitalized again.   - I do not trade derivatives at this time (futures/options).  I trade strictly in equities at this time, and don't plan on using derivaties at this time.  I think futures, especially, are too risky for a part-timer, or even an under-prepared full-timer, so I'm staying completely away from them for the forseeable future. - Net assets (including 401K which is considered a non-liquid asset due to taxation on it) is about $130,000.  And thats a conservative estimate.  My 401K comprises about $110,000 of that. - My monthly take-home from salary is about $4800 - I have one credit card with a balance on it, much of that debt is 0%, and almost half carries a 9.9% rate.  - I am an INTj  Any questions, feel free to ask.

I have just been waiting for this one specific place to open, and it finally has.  One of the main reasons this location is so great is because there is only one other restaurant within a mile of this place, so competition should not be too much of an issue.  Another reason is, it's right next to the only gas station in that area, so this is a high traffic location.  The main reason for me needing the funds is for the purchase of the all the equipment and the installation.  There will be a small amount needed for the remodeling of the building, but that will be minor due to me being able to do most the work myself.  Also, I would like to have a little bit of cash flow, I realize that I will probably not be making high amounts of profits within the first two or three weeks, so a little extra cash on the side wouldn't hurt.  One of my main inspirations for opening my own business, is my Father.  My Dad has been a successful owner/operator of his own restaurant for over 26 years, and he will be guiding me throughout this whole process .

The balance on one card is $4800 with 22% interest and $4700 with 20.5% interest.  I'm not sure how the interest rates crept up that high, as I have never been late with a payment, but I suppose that's how they get you.  I obtained both cards back in college and both had a $500 limit.  I paid the balance off in full each month and I was rewarded with credit limit increases until both were at $5k each (now much to my dismay). <br/><br/>I bought a home in April 2009.  The home was a foreclosure and I ended up using the credit cards to make it livable on the hopes of a promotion that I was in line for at work.  That promotion never came to fruition and I was stuck with the high balances.  Fast forward a year and I now have stable employment with the federal government, along with a higher salary, and I want to rid myself of these credit cards now.  One is already cut up, the other is for emergencies only.  I plan on using this loan to pay the balances of both off in full.  Whatever funds remain (~$1000) will be placed into a rainy day emergency fund.

Shortly after graduation, before I could make significant headway on my debt, congress passed the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act (CARD) in 2009.  As a response to this legislation, the interest rates on many of my cards skyrocketed, even though I have never been late on a payment and have always paid more than minimum.  This event made making real debt reduction even more difficult.<br/><br/>Securing this credit card consolidation loan will be a concrete step forward in improving my financial situation, as I will use it to pay off the credit cards that &quot;adjusted&quot; to the higher rates in 2009.  As a result, my outlook will greatly improve in at least three ways: 1) The interest rate reduction will result in greater monthly positive cash flow to service the remainder of my debts and 2) The transition of revolving credit to non-revolving will improve my credit score, which will allow me to 3) seek interest rate reductions on my other credit cards.  Even if #3 is unsuccesful, the positive impact of the other noted effects are too good to ignore at this time.<br/><br/>As far as my employment outlook, I have been with my current employer for the past 2 1/2 years, during which time I have been promoted once and have been told that I will be again this year.  I have strategically positioned myself in the company as a critical asset to several high-profile projects, which greatly reduces the prospect for lay-off, even in the current economic/political climate.  However, given the worst case scenario of job loss, my prospects for securing replacement employment are almost guaranteed, given my experience in the defense industry, my skill set, the location in which I live, and my security clearance.<br/><br/>My current monthly debt obligations, outside of the balances that would be paid off with this loan's proceeds, are:<br/>$2294 - Mortgage<br/>$750 - Credit cards<br/>$394 - Student loan<br/>$258 - Auto loan<br/><br/>Please note that there were significant contributing factors to my accrual of this revolving debt; but unfortunately I have been informed that I cannot include these in my loan description, as they may give hints to information that is disallowed by law in loan considerations.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration in funding this request.<br/>",credit_card,Credit Card Consolidation Loan,211xx,MD,18.84,0.0,Sep-1993,0.0,13.0,0.0,43213,83.7,22.0,0.0,Individual,0.0,0.0,Cash,0,0.5246309893174832,0.556759247609669,0.5378637342071784,0.6203898007310397,0.5535987740467783,0.3255952937928416,0.5816326530612245,0.2564285714285714,0.6051785714285715,0.17691326530612245,0.2614,0.727225,0.18442499999999998,0.41527500000000006,0.32464855793196506,0.3380050505050504,0.6901515151515151,0.4049242424242424,0.5953282828282829,0.4727272727272727,0.28325,0.594625,0.27799999999999997,0.507375,0.2044104870103659,0.29275,0.7635,0.25775000000000003,0.4875,0.38199999999999995

Two days after our wedding, we found out we needed a new air conditioner and a new furnace for the house.

We both brought some debt into the marriage and feel that it is very important to start our marriage off on the right foot.  We came to Lending Club to do just that.<br/><br/>The best way for us to get off on the right foot is to consolidate all of our debt, so that ultimately in 3 years we can be completely debt free (what an amazing thought that is).<br/><br/>We both have solid full time jobs (with absolutely no threat of being laid off).  And with this loan we ultimately would like to pay it off prior to the 36 months and between both incomes, we definitely have a shot at doing that.<br/><br/>I hope that you really consider helping fund our loan.  It would be awesome to be able to start our marriage off on a happier note :)<br/><br/>Please feel free to ask us any questions, we would be more than happy to answer anything.<br/> Borrower added on 06/27/10 > Thank you for taking the time to review our loan.<br/><br/>My beautiful wife and I were married May 21st 2010.  Two days after our wedding we found out that we needed to replace not just our air conditioner in our house, but also our furnace.  Not exactly the way a couple wants to start off their marriage.<br/><br/>We understand things like this happen and it really forced us to sit down and evaluate our finances.  We both brought some debt into the marriage (nothing really significant, but enough to make us look for a plan of action).  Which is what brought us to Lending Club - we want to start our marriage off on the right foot, by consolidating our debt and being close to debt free in 3 years (we can't even imagine how awesome that would be).<br/><br/>We are asking for $22,000 which will give us the amount we need to pay off all the debt we have minus a mortgage and some student loans.<br/><br/>For us to be able to do this would be huge - rather than paying finance charges for a number of small bills, to be able to pay one bill would rock - we really would be starting our married life off right.<br/><br/>Both my wife and I have steady full time jobs (with no threat of being laid off).  She has worked at a Harley-Davidson dealership for the past 4 years as an event coordinator/marketing manager and I have worked for Norfolk Southern Railroad as a Yardmaster for the past 6+ years.<br/><br/>We understand that it is not always easy to take a chance with your money, but we would hope that you consider funding our loan.  Ultimately we would like to pay this off in less than 36 months and now with our combined income, I can definitely see that as a possibility.

Since then, I've basically been making the payment but not making much headway on the balance. I just recently took a step back and decided to get everything lined up. I just refinanced my house, which reduced the interest rate over 1% and reduced my monthly payments by $220/month. I also just finished my car payments and that has saved another $445/month.

We paid off over $8,000.00 in debt this year and are fully committed to paying off our debt over the next few years.  I assure you that I am a very safe investment and look forward to a time where I can invest in people like myself.  Sometimes you just need a break, and a break for me is a LOWER FIXED APR.

I have debt on 2 credit cards and 1 car loan and would love to combine the payments so I only have to make one payment per month.  About 2 years ago I got laid off from my job and was without a full time job for approximately a year.  At this time, one month before I got laid off, I signed a new one year lease for my apartment.  I worked part time at a local restaurant to pay off bills etc while looking for a full time job.  At this point, I started falling behind on my bills and hence the debt on my 2 credit cards.  I now have a very stable job and I am working on a program that is funded for the next 30 years.  I am a very responsible person and I've never had a late payment on any of my loans.  I would be grateful in getting this loan as it will help to improve my credit score and put me in a better position to buy a house in the near future.  I hope you consider helping me out.

Not being a total idiot, I did get an agreement in writing. When I caught him cheating, I walked out, he retaliated by stealing my agreement out of my home. He did give me some funds that were to last me until I got another teaching job. Then a pilates teacher managed to herniate a disc in my neck causing me to have 5 hours of surgery, so the teaching was delayed. Being in a panic about money and the lack of, I decided to invest my money so that I would have enough money to live on until I could teach again, my brother-in-law insisted that I invest in a fund that he had his money in - long story short- that turned into a ponzi scheme and my $175,000 went to the way side; although I did manage to get the money into a trust agreement that may or may not ever pay out.<br/>I was extremely lucky to get a teaching job and then my second year I applied at an even better District and got a job there starting last August.<br/>My home is in Laguna Beach, I could not get a teaching job in Orange County but I did get one up North so I have had to move. I also had to take 3 classes at Stanford to help me get a better teaching job and it did.<br/>The move, the lack of income for 2 years, classes and both my children were married last year, all of things have caused me to run up my credit cards and I cannot seem to get ahead or save.<br/>I have equity in my home but the bank will not lend because of my high debt to income ratio. <br/>I need a fresh start so that I am not paying 26% on my credit card balances.

I was living in Iowa at the time and she was down from Las Vegas.    We hit if off instantly and within 7 weeks I proposed.  This happened last October but I wasn't able to move out to Las Vegas to be with her until March.  I am a very stable man and had been at my previous job for almost 7 years when I moved.    My fiance has worked at Medco for the last 6 years and would be contributing to paying off this loan with me. I worked for APAC in Iowa, a company Medco contracted with to handle some of their customer service.  In 3 weeks I will be starting with Medco myself but have been working elsewhere in the meantime.  I took the first thing I could find so I could move out to be with her.  I currently work at AT&T and do private security part time to make extra money so we wouldn't need as much funding.  While she is not on this loan with me, we share finances and together bring home $4,500 Net a month.  Our expenses are as follows: rent- 795 ulilities-140 cars-425 insurance-185 food-300 kindergarten tuition-300 Credit cards-200 phones-100 gas-160 misc-250  give or take a couple hundred due to unplanned expenses, we have over 1k a month in discretionary income.  My part time income of $800 per month is purely discretionary and I will not be quitting it once I start at Medco even though I will be making significantly more than I am currently making at AT&T.    We anticipate paying off this loan early as late Dec-Feb is overtime season at Medco.  We are both work-a-holics and try to work as much OT as we can.  We anticipate that with us both doing so, plus our tax returns next spring, we should have the loan paid off by April May.  My fiance grossed over 5k in the month of January alone this year.  Our predicament is that I can't get a loan through a bank because I just moved to be with her and don't have the current job history or address history necessary.  I can assure any lender that I am VERY responsible and stable.  She also has had a lot of past medical collections on her credit that she has worn herself out trying to fight.  They are all errors and when we tried to apply for a loan with her as the primary because she has the current history, we were denied because of her credit.    We are getting Married Dec. 14th.  We make plenty of money to make the monthly payments.  We have already paid $5,500 toward the wedding and honeymoon but can't get it all paid off before hand.  We can get it paid off within the year at the latest easily.  Thank you in advance to all the lenders that support our wedding and honeymoon.

Again I plan to use this money for legal council for child custody.  I have most of the money myself, but I need an extra cushion to proceed.  I am a good borrower because I have way above average credit (700+), have no delinquencies on my record, and have established that I have made all payments in a timely matter.  Furthermore, the payments for this loan will be automatically deducted from my bank account in order to insure no late fees.  I plan to pay this off before the 5 years........I'm thinking 1-2.

The loan will stem the tide of residual credit debt and will allow myself and my family to begin anew. Aside from the salary I average about a $5,000 bonus each year. I was unable to clear the debt up earlier because once I began my professional career I supported my stepdaughter and her 2 children as she fought through a long custody battle with an abusive ex-husband. My wife and I basically paid half her legal fees and helped her feed and cloth my grandkids. Needless to say they are all good; things have turned out well for them. But now my wife and I need to clean things up and this loan will do exactly that, take us out of the debt that, though some may disagree, was a Godsend in helping us get through the trials and tribulations of the past 5 years.

I appreciate your support. Second, I would like to take a few moments to appeal to any would-be investors.  <br/><br/>This is the most I have ever been in debt, and I am trying frantically to climb out as fast as I can.  Like I said, I have incurred several 1 time expenses that had to be put on my credit card including medical expenses, car repairs, and thanks to a mix-up by my former employer, some back taxes.  I am applying for this loan to get a lower interest rate.<br/><br/>I have an excellent payment history. I also have excellent job security. I am a postdoctoral fellow, currently doing neurobiology research.  Currently I have a 3-year contract, with an option to renew after that. In addition, I am a licensed pharmacist, so if anything were to happen, I could always pick up a pharmacy job, so my income is very very secure at this time. During my time as a graduate student, I received a small but decent stipend.  Despite all the debt I incurred, I was still able to pay off my car, and pay off some undergraduate loans during my graduate school career.  At this time, I am still making all my payments on time, and making progress on paying down my debt. This loan is very vital, as it will allow me to pay down my debt faster, and will allow me to get away from high credit card interest rates.  Thank you for taking the time to read this, and for taking time to consider financing my loan. After my debt is paid off, I can start to think about planning a wedding (it is out of the question now, I want to pay my debt off first) and start a family.

The debt is from credit cards that I used while in college which have all seen increases in the interest rates to very high levels.  In the past I had not worried so much about the card interest or making lump payoffs in order to keep my primary checking in good order.  The card companies have made the obvious mistake jacking up my interest (IMO)... I hope to pay investors of this loan a ""fair"" amount of interest instead and leave them with none.  I am currently paying around $500/month to the various cards to avoid paying a ton of interest.  About $3000 will take care of this debt.  A consequence of paying on debt is that I've only saved about $1000 in the past 8 months.  Therefore the other portion of this money will be going towards moving forward in a relationship (engagement).  I feel I am a good candidate for this loan.  I do have school and auto debt but it is very manageable.  I also hold a good paying job as an engineer in a very stable industry.

With the drought in financing to acquire homes I have lately been buying mobile homes located in mobile home parks with cash and renting them out.  I buy the mobiles with my cash and rehab them. Once the home is completed and filled with a tenant or tenant/buyer I obtain a private lending loan to recover my cost and to move on to the next project.  This loan would cover my acquisition and rehab cost for the property. The tenant pays a weekly rent of $120 a week. The lot rent is $170 a month. This property cash flows approximately $350 a month averaged out over the course of a year leaving plenty of room for a loan of $5000.  My Experience:  I have acquired over 50 properties in the past 3 years and run a property management company that manages over 150 units in the Northwest Georgia area.  I have raised over $500,000 in private money for acquiring single family homes over the past 3 years and continue to do so. I can provide documentation of security deeds for mortgages from my private lenders and the cancellations showing that the loans were paid off.  I have two full time contractors that work for me and rehab the properties that we acquire and we quickly fill most all of our units.  My private money website for the single family homes is located at http://www.privatedollar.com. My management company's website is located at http://www.picksimple.com.  Please note that my credit rating may seem risky however in general my score is most affected by my debt to income. I have several mortgages on my report in addition the income on my tax returns being lower due to the number of deductions I take from my business so please keep that in mind.  There are no late payments and I can provide references of private lenders who my local area who will verify my timely payments and also references of lenders who have loaned me money before and that I have paid off.  Thank you and I look forward to working with you.

Going into more detail, the funds will be used to pay off four credit card balances which currently have ridiculously high APR's and the one car loan that we have (which weâve had for three years now).  Working in the Lending industry ourselves, we understand the importance of having good credit and establishing excellent relationships with our creditors.  We were able to negotiate lower interest rates on two of our credit lines and for the past several months were able to pay them off.  But now we are finding it increasingly difficult to âsee the light at the end of the tunnelâ with the other four credit card companies that arenât willing to budge when it comes to their rates.  Joining this peer-to-peer lending group is what we consider to be a no-brainer.  We can get a much better grasp of the three years Lending Club is offering.  And at the rate we are going right now with our other creditors, heaven only knows when we would be able to totally pay off our credit line debt.  It has taken a while; but weâve finally brought our credit scores to the mid 700âs.  One of our financial goals is to further improve our credit and establish credit ratings over 800 by the end of 2010.  In spite of this debt we are in, we do consider ourselves lucky.  There are others out there who find themselves in deep by tens and even hundreds of thousands of dollars.  It could have been worse for us â and we both agree that itâs a necessity, especially during these times, to take control of our debt and not make it worse.  Hopefully, with the Lending Clubâs and your help, my wife and I will be able to attain these financial goals, improve our quality of life and provide us the opportunity to someday help others who may have the similar financial goals and aspirations.

I am now working on paying it off, but I am not making very much progress. I got a full time job on the financial side of VA Hospitals (where I worked as a student while going to school), and decided I would use my credit card for the rewards and then pay off what I spend each month, which didn't work.  I currently understand my budget, have a spreadsheet, and am a debit card user only.  However, the interest rate on the credit card is 29.9% so I am not making very much progress even though I always pay more than the minimum.  My job is very stable.  The department I work for has grown since I started working there as a student and since I started full time (in March) I have gone from student to full time and been promoted.  This loan would allow me to pay off my credit card debt at a lower interest rate and paying less per month than the current payments I make (around $500-550/month).    Currently I owe:  Citi 10500 at 29.9% Best Buy 1300 (0% promotional rate from when I bought a TV 2 years ago for another 12 months). I would pay off the Citi Card but leave the Best Buy option because of the low rate.  I am serious about eliminating my debt. This loan would allow me to do so in 3 years max (my goal is 2.5 after paying additional amounts through tax returns, bonuses, etc).  I am ready to live debt free.  To those who funded my loan previously, it was removed due to trouble verifying my job and income. I have been assured by LC Credit that the problems were solved and both have been verified.

Sorry I didn't tell anyone about myself...I started this process on break, at work, then couldn't finish because we were so busy!  I am a registered nurse, working 33 hours/week in a doctor's office/recovery room.  I have been helping my oldest daughter pay down her student loan from college- she works full time, but low-paying job.  My son (graduating college this May) also works, but getting fewer and fewer hours, so my mom and I share helping him with his living expenses.  He was able to get scholarships and grants for the first 3 years of college, but I am paying the loan on his senior year and 1/2 his rent/room/board.  My middle daughter has also been relying on my help.  Her husband has abandoned her and their 3-year old daughter.  She is working full time, but cannot afford her apartment but also was not allowed out of her lease.  She will be moving back home, but I have had to help with her rent fairly frequently over the past 6 months.  No surprise, my income simply cannot cover all that plus my normal household bills.  My husband was laid off last January (2010)- he has been mostly steadily working temp. jobs and making enough to cover the mortgage on our house, plus groceries.  I am making up payments for everything else.  No surprise, during the lean periods I have had to use the credit card and line-of-credit to pay normal expenses.  I want this loan to pay off my line-of-credit, one small personal loan, and both credit cards.  And, no, I can't increase my work hours...on my days off, I watch my granddaughter- daycare is so expensive, my daughter would be forced deeper into debt paying for it.<br/>Thank you all for your questions- I really appreciate you all so much.

I am sure some of you have moved over to The Lending Club, as I have also. The first loan helped me pay off debts accumulated by my ex-wife and the second loan help me purchase a new car. During both of these loans, I kept my promise to be a responsible borrower and paid my loans on time each month, never being late. <br/><br/>Purpose of this loan: <br/><br/>The purpose of this loan is to pay off my current Prosper loan ($3000), my Visa card ($4800), and my Mastercard ($2100). I will be replacing my currently monthly Prosper payment of $663.24, my Visa payment of approx. $250, and my Mastercard payment of approx. $250, with one payment that should be under $400 per month. I should see a savings of about $700 per month by acquiring this loan.<br/><br/>My financial situation:<br/>I have a stable job which I have been at for the last 5 Â½ years now and 19 years in my profession. I was the only one in my company who received a promotion and received a raise within last year. I choose to borrow from The Lending Club because I personally like the idea of giving the interest that I would be paying to a bank, to people who invest in Lending Club borrowers. I currently have 35 active notes myself as a Prosper lender and have seen my share of borrower defaults. I can guarantee you that this is by far the safest loan you can bid on at The Lending Club. I have had a $7000 loan and a $20,000 loan funded by Prosper lenders in the past and take pride in the fact that I have never been late on any of them.<br/><br/>Monthly net income: $5,400 before taxes (not including my wife's income)<br/><br/>Monthly expenses (with this new loan):<br/>Tithe: $ 540<br/>The Lending Club Loan: $ 420<br/>Housing: $ 1750<br/>Insurance: $ 60<br/>Car expenses: $ 300 (Fuel) - No Car Payment<br/>Utilities: $ 250<br/>Phone, cable, internet: $ 200<br/>Credit cards and other loans: $ 125<br/>Other expenses: $ 0<br/><br/>As you can see, I am actually in really in good finiancal shape and can easliy make the payment on this loan.

I just sold the boat for $3200 on Ebay and I will be selling my truck that I used to tow the boat since I have no need for that. I should get around $4000 for that since it is a 1999 Chevy Silverado. I just did my taxes and my refund is $2600. With this money I will pay off the rest of my flight school loan and start a savings fund for a down payment on a house. I make $13 an hour as a maintenance supervisor and I go to school full time. I was in the Army and I am currently in the National Guard. The guard pays 100% tuition and my GI Bill pays me $1300 a month to go to school. I have 3 credit cards two are around $300 and one is at $1000. I live with my girlfriend and we split the rent and cell phone bill. My bills for the month are around $800.   With the money I will buy a motorcycle for under $10,000 and keep 1-2000 as another emergency fund. I already have $1000 set aside for emergencies. I figured it would be best to buy a motorcycle since insurance is cheap.  My credit rating has been in the low 700's and I want it as close to 800 as possible. I rather keep an installment loan to reach that score so I can save money on a mortgage some day.

I was hooked almost immediately after trying it. Ever since we were married (2000), my wife has been looking for a group to practice taiko with in Michigan. About three years ago, we decided that instead fo waiting around for someone else to start a taiko group, we would just make our own group. So I found a job in Japan, and we have been here for the past two years, studying taiko with all our energy.  We are priviledged to be able to study at Japan's most famous taiko maker, Asano Taiko, with instructors from one of Japan's best taiko groups, Hono Taiko.   We are now approaching the time when we will return to Michigan and begin recruiting students and teaching taiko drumming. For that purpose, we need to purchase some drums. We have collected some over the years, but not enough to have a class of more than three or four people.  We are trying to raise about $5000 in order to purchase a set of 10 drums to get us started.   If you don't know much about taiko drumming, it is a wonderful and very rewarding activity. It can be enjoyed simply as an extra-curricular activity, but is also beneficial to health, can be used as a therapy tool and helps to build positive relationships within groups.  We have been collecting surveys to gauge interest in taiko drumming in Michigan and nearly all the responses have been very positive.  We are very grateful if you will help us to achieve our dream.",major_purchase,Japanese drums for taiko school in Mich,481xx,MI,5.09,0.0,Aug-1991,0.0,7.0,0.0,112,1.1,18.0,0.0,Individual,0.0,0.0,Cash,0,0.3560799796679529,0.399010422181341,0.5050207455824455,0.3152380110910439,0.472726127351402,0.3544609679270266,0.5816326530612245,0.2564285714285714,0.6051785714285715,0.17691326530612245,0.2614,0.727225,0.18442499999999998,0.41527500000000006,0.32494975548685046,0.3380050505050504,0.6901515151515151,0.4049242424242424,0.5953282828282829,0.4727272727272727,0.28325,0.594625,0.27799999999999997,0.507375,0.2012089109472214,0.29275,0.7635,0.25775000000000003,0.4875,0.38199999999999995

Currently my wife and I are in the process of completing various home improvement projects.  We purchased our home approximately 4.5 years ago with hopes of living in the home for 2-3 years before upgrading to a more permanent residence.  However, the downturn in the economy has driven our home value down and unfortunately I don't see this changing in the near future.  As such we are completing a home renovation to make the best of what we have!  I am hoping to install some wood flooring as well as adding an air conditioner.  We are also going to be doing some sprucing up by adding paint and new window coverings.  Lastly my loan will be to clear out approximately $1,400 in credit card debt.  <br/><br/>In doing these projects my reasons are two-fold.  First and foremost we want to make our house more our own as we will likely be staying longer than we originally planned.  However in doing so I am hoping to create a home that in the long-term will be more inviting to potential buyers or renters when we decide to make a move.  Secondly, I would like to get the current debt I have in credit cards moved into a time driven pay-off type of debt.  Unfortunately my credit card interest rates are incredibly high and I would like to consolidate to more reasonable rates.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration of my loan request.<br/>",home_improvement,Home Project,970xx,OR,17.05,0.0,Aug-2000,0.0,9.0,0.0,11515,49.8,16.0,0.0,Individual,0.0,0.0,Cash,0,0.5728217340506225,0.5603158885442514,0.642061271527905,0.6627219447290775,0.6565590996545279,0.34325442463217604,0.5816326530612245,0.2564285714285714,0.6051785714285715,0.17691326530612245,0.2614,0.727225,0.18442499999999998,0.41527500000000006,0.3246645597514241,0.3380050505050504,0.6901515151515151,0.4049242424242424,0.5953282828282829,0.4727272727272727,0.28325,0.594625,0.27799999999999997,0.507375,0.20017015282563078,0.29275,0.7635,0.25775000000000003,0.4875,0.38199999999999995

My well staffed small business offers personal training for adults, kids and teens, group classes, boot camps, intensive's, workshops, and much more. We have established ourselves in our community and we are known for outstanding service, incredible programs, dedication to our clients, as well as having great marketing and brand awareness.<br/><br/>This loan will be used to continue to grow what has already been put in place. After seven great years I know we are capable of even more volume and bigger numbers. The demand for what we offer is high and how we do it is different than our competitors. I know this is why we grew during the recession when most other fitness programs went out of business.<br/><br/>Specifically this money would go to several advertising programs, with a good portion of it going to a new website. I think a well organized web site is key for growth. My vision for the new site is one that has exceptional navigation, a clean design, clear content, video's of what we do and how we are different, as well as easy to fill out sign up forms and effortless payment options. Since visibility is key I want to purchase and sell our custom tee shirts. Our designs are easy to read and look great, ensuring they are often worn by clients around town. To date these tee's have given us a great deal of advertising while making our current clients feel special. The balance of the money will be used for new promotional pieces, local advertising, and PR. <br/><br/> We have always paid our employee's, independent contractors, and service providers on time. We have never had an outstanding bill or billing issue. We are in good standing with our bank as well as with our two business credit cards, never having a payment or credit issue. We have successfully and with ease rented offices and studio space. We have worked closely with local cities and been approved to rent space in city owned property. <br/><br/>In the seven years I have ran my company I have always had solid cash flow and never needed to take other work. Personally, I have a proven track record of being financially responsible.<br/><br/>Lending to my small business is not only a solid financial investment, it's a unique opportunity to help many people realize what's possible in their lives by becoming healthy, fit, and strong.<br/>",small_business, Successful business looking to grow,902xx,CA,0.28,1.0,Nov-1999,0.0,5.0,0.0,383,15.3,11.0,0.0,Individual,0.0,0.0,Cash,0,0.4044675571385394,0.6228610040160841,0.5325638669234742,0.5406249063301003,0.5640318451379119,0.33790865737647857,0.5816326530612245,0.2564285714285714,0.6051785714285715,0.17691326530612245,0.2614,0.727225,0.18442499999999998,0.41527500000000006,0.32474608440901753,0.3380050505050504,0.6901515151515151,0.4049242424242424,0.5953282828282829,0.4727272727272727,0.28325,0.594625,0.27799999999999997,0.507375,0.20638789149087255,0.29275,0.7635,0.25775000000000003,0.4875,0.38199999999999995

I believe it would be higher if I had a longer credit history. I am financially responsible, hold a steady income, and own my home. In the last seven months of employment since graduation, I have paid off over $6000 in student loan and credit card debt. <br/><br/>About the Loan:<br/><br/>I have been paying Sallie Mae faithfully every month for two years now and only $700 has come off the principal on my student loan of $5000. They estimate that I have another 7 years left to pay it off at their 11.8% interest rate. I would much rather have it paid off in 3 years, while paying off my credit cards as well. <br/><br/>I have four credit cards, two of which are fully paid off. They have a total limit of over $30,000. I have $6500 charged to two of them leftover from when I was in college. Both have the same high interest rates they had when I got them during school (one is around 15% and the other is about 18%).<br/><br/>With this loan, I intend to pay off the Sallie Mae remainder ($4300) and these cards ($6500) in one convenient monthly payment.

My income was slightly lower at the time so I couldn't get the full amount needed to consolidate.  My income is better now and since Citi Bank and GE Money Bank raised my interest rate on my 2 remaining credit cards (only 2 with balances that revolve), I'd like to just &quot;wrap those up&quot; with the current Lending Club  loan I have (which I pay on time with no problem every month). <br/><br/>My FICO:<br/><br/>Experian - 786 (per Wells Fargo internal)<br/>Equifax - 792 (per www.myfico.com)<br/>Transunion - 791 (per www.myfico.com)<br/><br/>Breakdown:<br/><br/>$18,000 total<br/>(10,511 to pay off/refi Lending Club)<br/>(4800 to pay Citi) - Charging me 18.99% interest.  They &quot;kindly&quot; lowered it from 26.99%. How nice. <br/>(1700 to pay GE Money Bank) - Interest rate is 23.99%. <br/><br/><br/>Why 60 month term? <br/>-Flexibility is key.  I'm in the financial service industry and nothing is ever certain as you can imagine.  As much as I'd love to go 36 months at a lower rate, I'd feel safer doing a 60 month term just in case.  I have enough in reserves to cover a $400 payment for this loan for 12 months along with fixed expenses.  <br/><br/>Why didn't I ask for the 18k the first time?<br/>-Great question. To be honest, I was a little naive and just assumed I wouldn't get approved.  I also wasn't sure how Lending Club worked and was tentative to &quot;put all my eggs in one basket&quot; so to speak.  In hindsight, it wasn't the smartest decision as I've ended up paying more in interest due to my tentativeness.  Now I'm ready to wipe all of these credit cards off! <br/><br/>Is my job safe?<br/>- Wells Fargo has been around since 1852. I am doing very well here and out of all the banks, Wells Fargo seems to be the most stable in terms of job security.  <br/><br/>Why Should You Invest In Me?<br/>- Because I'm essentially a guaranteed return.  I have funds in reserves to cover me should anything happen to my job.  I have a low debt to income ratio (20-26%).  I have no mortgage or rent.  I have inclining income, stable job, AND residence.  Last and certainly not least, I have perfect pay history with all lenders, MOST IMPORTANTLY, with Lending Club.  I have never been late on any payments on any debt...ever.  <br/><br/>More questions? Fire them away.  <br/><br/>Thanks for investing in me and helping me achieve my financial goals.<br/> Borrower added on 08/24/11 > Faxed up all paystubs and W2. - Thanks.<br/> Borrower added on 08/26/11 > Any questions from any hesitant investors?<br/> Borrower added on 08/27/11 > FICO showing 750-780 on your end because I paid off and closed out WFFNB/EXPRESS and WFNNB Victoria's Secrets.

I simply was not budgeting myself well right out of college, and I did not realize how far into debt I was getting myself into.  I now have more income and am more responsible. While I can usually make more than the minimum payments, the interest rates are so high, I barely make a dent in my debt.  Without this loan, I will not be debt free for at least 5 years, and my savings will suffer as a result.  My debt is spread out over 3 high interest credit cards.  If I could consolidate my debt into one payment, it would be much more manageable. I always pay my bills on time, and I now have a working budget, so I am not adding to the debt I have.  I am a safe investment for you.

I have over 14 years selling, building, and assembling race cars.  This is truly a passion of mine and I can't wait to grow the business. My need for these additional funds is to help with additional business startup cost.  These include logo design, website development, raw material purchases, and equipment.  I have currently invested over $75k into this business venture between the cost of the building (3000sf), tools, machinery and professional services.  Currently to date I have registered my LLC, received my EIN, begun development of my logo, registered my domain name, and consulted a tax attorney.  I recently attended a trade show to reunite with old customers to grow the business through word of mouth.  I am not seeking traditional business startup funding from other avenues since my needs are very small.  I have run a race related business entirely before and maintain a large number of contacts throughout the market to develop sales leads and promote my business.  All of this is done after hours of my current job and therefore does not cause any conflict of interest issues.    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>I am current on all debts that I have.  I am never late.  I am still living within my means and taking on this additional loan will not become a burden I cannot handle.  This money is only going to help grow my business which will increase my revenue intake, therefore helping to pay this loan off ahead time.
