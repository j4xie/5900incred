My condo is in ""North Bethesda, MD""... approx. 4 miles North of Bethesda (an appreciating to stable market) and 6 miles South of Rockville (designated a declining market).  The need to borrow is created by timing.  I estimate that the current value of the divorce assets is approximately $200,000.  My ex-wife and I were married in the State of NC.  NC law indicates an equitable distribution should apply.  The goal is to invest up to $20,000 in hiring a competent divorce attorney to achieve the $100,000 in assets.    The assets from the divorce will be used to settle all debts.  Remaining proceeds would start a retirement fund, begin investments and be used to fund additional education.

I even tried a credit service, but after some research I felt that my credit score would be harmed by the strategies of some of the companies. My goal is to pay off all my debt before I buy a home. I do not want to take on a mortgage with the self debt that I have acquired. I need to consolidate with a low interest to get the debt paid off in a reasonable amount of time.

My mentor/manager asked me to help cover some advertising costs by using my CC.  He failed to deliver on his promises to pay it off swiftly.  Several years later,  I seldom  hear from him.  So paying this off fully, not just covering the minimum payment, is my responsibility and personal mission.  My credit card company cannot reduce my rate b/c I voluntarily shut the card down a few years ago.  They suggest that I go through their debt managemtent solution to set up a plan.  But I can't go to a 'Debt Modification' arrangement b/c I'm in the financial services industry, and that would be a problem for future job disclosure forms, etc.  So I am looking to get ahead of my interest payments, so as to actually begin reducing the principal significantly.  By having a lower rate, the $500-700/month for this loan will dramatically increase the proportion of my payment which is paying down principal.   My financial situation:  I am a good candidate for this loan because my take home pay varies b/t 2,500 and 3,500 per month due to various components of my pay structure.  One component is an override from my entire office's revenue [that began in Oct 07], due to my integral involvement with many other associates' accounts.  After my job change in 2005, aroundthe same time as Hurricane Katrina, my income took a big hit.  But over the last 2+ year it has increased nearly 50% each year.  As thing are today, I am on pace to make at least $40,000 gross in 2008.  Any new accounts/clients/revenue are on top of this $40,000 income base.  My expenses are fairly low considering.  No car payment, low rent, gas is taken care of.  And ultimately, as a Certified Financial Planner, I would never allow my own finances to go into default or bankruptcy because my career would be finished.  I want to get this monkey off my back ASAP, and a lower rate loan would enable my to get financially fit much, much faster.

My bring home pay each month, including child support, is $3200. Currently, I have $20 taken from each pay check and put into a saving's account and my bank also offers a saving's system which transfers $1 from your checking into saving's for every transaction. In a typical month I can save about $120 between the paycheck deductions and the transaction transfers. <br/>My approximate balances and APRs for credit cards are:<br/>$923  - 29.9%<br/>$2510- 27.9%<br/>$1825- 29.9%<br/>$2081- 26.9%<br/>$1371- 24.9%<br/>$954-   19.1%<br/>$619-    9.9%<br/>$1864- 0% for one year<br/>Unfortunately, a few of these credit card debts ($1864- 0%, and the $1825-29.9%) arose from having a pet with a serious medical condition who died after the $1864 stay at the animal hospital. The rest of the debt was more bearable prior to the last 6 months of medical problems with the dog. <br/>In the last year, I paid off 2 other credit cards and have not used them since then, I didn't close out the accounts because I was told it looks bad on your credit report, so they are just not in use. The rest of this debt I plan on paying off prior to the 5 year payment plan that I chose for this debt consolidation loan. <br/>I am the sole wage earner in my household as I was recently divorced and, unfortunately, the one who kept the debt. This is why it is imperative for me to find a way to reduce my monthly expenses by consolidating these high interest credit card payments. I have two children to care for and plan for their futures, with this credit card debt it is difficult for me to provide for them and save for their futures at the same time. <br/>I am only requesting 8k for the consolidation because the other debts that I owe have lower interest rates than what was offered through the initial loan application process, and I plan on paying off the interest free one when I receive my tax return. <br/>Hope I answered all of your questions!  :)<br/>",debt_consolidation,Amy's Relief,329xx,FL,20.4,0.0,Sep-1995,2.0,31.0,0.0,11712,78.1,57.0,0.0,Individual,0.0,0.0,Cash,1,0.5463520153263232,0.4887310364602196,0.5374732491659834,0.4748132513571212,0.4448491506040515,2109

Since we will carry the largest selection of products from these wholesalers, we will be able to compete with even the big retailers on price. With competitive prices and the largest selection in the area, we are confident that we will be the preferred choice of many of the customers who love these brands and apparel.<br/><br/>Our store concept is one of a kind. While there may be similar stores in other geographical areas, there are no stores of this nature and this size in this region. With this uniqueness we plan to further differentiate ourselves from the competition by the way we do business. We plan to have a simple nautical and fishing theme as our store d&eacute;cor, something very different from other retailers. Our staff is to be friendly and attentive to help our customers in whatever they need. We also realize that although much of our clothing apparel is targeted to males, females do the majority of shopping and purchasing in a typical family. That is why we will make an effort to reach out to these customers with a large selection of women&rsquo;s coastal apparel that cannot be matched elsewhere. We have a passion for these clothes and brands ourselves. When people are passionate with what they do and what they sell, their passion is evident. With our selection of brands, depth of product lines, emphasis in customer service, good location, and a passion in what we do and sell, we are set to become the retailer of choice for coastal outdoor enthusiasts.<br/><br/>I will gladly answer any questions about the business in a timely manner. My formal education background is a Bachelor's degree in Business Management with a concentration in Entrepreneurship from the University of Alabama.

It has been in existence for three years and experienced a 520% rate of growth in the past 14 months.   The Federal government ties money to compliance with regulations so my training has become a  necessity for schools. The ARRA stimulus package will more than double the annual federal dollars given to my state. However, there are strict guidelines for how the money can be spent.   There are five main areas were federal money can be spent. My current company falls within 2 of these 5 areas. A new website that is currently in development, and slated to go live in August, 09, will meet another 2 of the areas so that I will offer a program that meets 4 of 5 potential spending categories. This nearly guarantees that schools will funnel some of their ARRA money to my company.   Teachers will use the website 1) to network with others around the state--sharing lesson plans and assessment tools, and collaborating to create projects,  and 2) to streamline paperwork and facillitate input from everyone involved in a student's progress. Administrators will use the website 1) to ensure teacher compliance with regulations, and 2) to communicate with staff and parents.

I would be extremely grateful if you would help me out of a high-interest credit card situation. I have been with my employer full-time for over 14 years. I usually pay more than the minimum on my credit cards, so if I can consolidate my payments into one I will be able to pay off my debt sooner. I have the money taken straight out of my checking account so I am never late. I paid back all of my student loans and I recently finished paying off my car. I have been successful in having some of my interest rates lowered, although not very much and with revolving interest rates. In any case, I would prefer to give my money to people who are willing to help each other out. I am eager to get out of debt, so again, thank you in advance for your help!<br/> Borrower added on 06/28/10 > Hello and thank you for your questions. I intend to pay back this loan in the same way that I am currently paying back my credit cards. I am able to pay the monthly notes due, but with a flat rate it will be easier to budget over the long term. I applied for the total balance of my debt but the loan offered was for the listed amount, which I accepted. I've never done this before, so I don't know if it would have helped to wait until after payday when my bills are automatically paid and the total debt obviously would be a bit lower. Although I won't be able to completely consolidate all my debts into one, the loan will go to completely pay off the highest interest card and partially pay the next-highest card which is on a revolving interest, so my payments there will actually go a longer way. Even if my total monthly payments out remains the same a larger portion will actually be paying down my debt and I will be debt free much sooner. I use a Discover card for my monthly expenses to keep track of where my money goes and that I pay in full each month. I acquired most of the debt after a long-term relationship breakup over a year ago. My bills suddenly doubled and it took a while for me to sort out my finances and make lifestyle changes that would allow me to be able to handle living on my own on my salary. I had a car payment at the time that I do not have now, so that goes to paying back my debts as well. My job is secure, I know where my money goes each month, and I know that this loan is well within my budget. In fact, it is lower than what I currently pay monthly on my high-interest credit card. Thank you to the people who have funded the loan so far. It is in my best interest as well, so I will make sure that you get your investment back.<br/>",debt_consolidation,people not banks,787xx,TX,11.19,0.0,Jun-1989,1.0,14.0,0.0,13972,20.2,23.0,0.0,Individual,0.0,0.0,Cash,0,0.5684957697074968,0.5708927189821551,0.6209294881685408,0.589367842080125,0.6377372577418936,2600

Bradley is currently studying to receive his Bachelors in business management. The business will consist of 24 hour access to a gym. The gym will currently consist solely on the use of the gym and will offer Yoga and Pilates in the near future. Esther is registered to become a certified Yoga instructor mid-2009. According to City-Data.com (2009) the population of Belfair is over 6 thousand residents. Grapeview/Allyn also has a population of more than 2 thousand residents. The location, which is along highway 3 across from the Safeway store and next to the Kitsap bank, is the main thoroughfare to Bremerton for north-Mason Residents. The current facility has 72 individuals on a monthly payment plan to use the services. The only facility in the area is the one in place and has not allowed new members in several months. We will use advertising on the building, which is highly visible from the main thoroughfare of highway 3. The organization will also be referred clients from the sole local Physical therapy in Belfair, Belfair Physical therapy. Once the completion of the physical therapy is complete, Belfair Physical Therapy will recommend a membership at the establishment. We will also receive referrals from Abel Wellness, which is also located in the building to be used. 	The monthly price will be approximately $30 a month for the gym and $50 a month for access to the yoga and Pilates along with the gym. The current expected fixed cost is $5100 a month and will need approximately 170 members to break even. There are currently 72 members, therefore, only 100 more are needed to break even. 	Our Plan is for either Esther or Bradley to occupy the business during business hours and use an access control system for the after business hours.

As business picks up, I will cut back hours at my current job.  I have talked with my boss about this and she supports my plan.<br/><br/>My background:<br/><br/>After graduating from high school, I attended college for a year and a half.  I decided to quit college and get a job.  Got a job with a school district as a computer tech for the high school.  Within two years, I became the district network administrator through hard work and teaching myself the required skills.  After 9/11, I decided to join the US Army in which I served for 5 years at Fort Drum, NY.  I received several citations for my strong work ethic and performance.  I then moved to Fairbanks, AK and started working for Morning Star Ranch, my current employer.  Within a few weeks of working there, I was put in a position of authority to direct my coworkers and handle the money in the boss's absence.  I am someone that my boss relies upon as the go-to guy.<br/><br/>The business:<br/><br/>I have been searching for a business to start up since I've been out of the military.  Cleanpro is the first business that I've come across that I felt would give me job satisfaction, a good income, and will stand out from other competitors.  The Cleanpro method of cleaning carpets is different from steam cleaning in some very important ways.  First, the solutions are all organic and citrus based and they leave no residue after drying to attract dirt.  They are safe to use around pets and people.  Second, the carpet dries in one to two hours.  The carpet isn't saturated down through the pad so there isn't a chance for mold or bacteria to grow.  Finally and most importantly is that it gets the carpet clean.  I called a few owners up in different parts of the country to ask them if the results were as good as what promotional video said.  All of the people I talked to, owners and employees, said it was better.  That they are still amazed at how clean the carpets get and how long they stay clean.<br/><br/>I fully believe that this business is going to work and I've already put $15,000 deposit down with Cleanpro USA LLC that goes toward the licensing and equipment that is needed.  This loan will fund the remaining cost of the equipment, a used delivery van, insurance, travel costs for training, and other start up costs.  <br/><br/>Please feel free to ask me any questions, and thank you for your time.<br/>",small_business,Life Improvement Loan,997xx,AK,19.86,0.0,Jan-1997,0.0,10.0,0.0,4175,17.0,26.0,0.0,Individual,0.0,0.0,Cash,0,0.4238502405368253,0.3710963862333307,0.5077415735626458,0.4458722271671176,0.6307025921801082,2708

If I get fully funded, I'm going to pay off my accounts with the highest balance and highest interest rates.  I'll be paying close to the same amount every month but my debt will be paid off in five years instead of thirty!  I've <br/>already been paying more than the minimum amount due to the other accounts so, they'll be paid off within the next three <br/>years.<br/><br/>Althouth this may hurt my chances with some of you, some of you may want to know, I'm a police officer.

You may have heard that real-estate is suffering now because of the recession. This is currently true except for the location I work, Raleigh, NC. Raleigh is actually seeing steady growth while the rest of the countries home prices are still slipping. Things will stabilize later on this year but in the meantime I am looking to increase the size of my business in preparation for this influx by getting this loan. My marketing plans include a website with Neighborhood Monthly Market Reports, Lead Generation Software, a personal assistant, and a buyer's agent.      Those who spend money in a recession on their business see 200% profits afterward while those who don't only see 50% growth.   How will I repay?      I own three cash-flow properties, stocks, bonds, and have savings. This loan will give me the extra boost I need to see a successful year in real-estate.  I am a trustworthy individual with a Bachelor's degree in science and some grad school in a PhD program. I am dedicated and honest.

I see the potential in generating a great profit by providing the lowest price's on all the services my company has to offer to draw in customers, and also I have 4 years experience as an Independent film maker/actor as well so I know exactly what services are in high demand.  I have gathered info on potential business competitors, seen their rates, and what they offer, and though I am starting out small, I see myself having a greatly beneficial edge, in that 1, I am the only company to offer multiple services (acting classes, headshots, film equipment rentals, etc.) at one location. <br/>     With this loan, I will be able to invest in various advertising campaigns, (online, newspaper, flyers, etc.) as well as business cards, brochures, outdoor signs, and a new website.   For the first 1-2 years, my plan is to take all gross profits and 1st, repay any loan(s), and 2nd to invest back into my business to further expand my inventory and reach my goal of doubling my income from year one, and tripling my income for year 3 of business. With the recession knocking a lot of businesses out, I see this as a great time during our rebuilding phase to get my business to take off. Films are still being made, shows are still running, and there are countless potential customers in independent film makers looking to film their ideas.<br/>",small_business,Business,915xx,CA,7.91,0.0,Apr-2001,0.0,4.0,0.0,985,89.5,12.0,0.0,Individual,0.0,0.0,Cash,0,0.4815099497899744,0.5109515825685109,0.5973826471825397,0.5539792806809541,0.7311604410176088,1921

My profile shows one delinquency which is a mistake on my credit report that I have in dispute with an old apartment complex.  Otherwise, I have perfect credit and thus a very low credit risk.

This will decrease my housing costs by about 700.00 per month.  I may also use a portion of it for debt consolidation.<br/> Borrower added on 11/04/10 > I have a stable income.  I have a professional degree and have been continuously employed in my field since earning my degree.  I have a very loyal client following, enjoy my work very much and plan to continue working in my current capacity until I retire.  I take my financial responsibilities seriously and have never defaulted on a loan.<br/><br/>I purchased a foreclosed property this past summer.  The property is a fenced acre with a double wide manufactured home on it.  Manufactured homes are very common in this part of the country.  The well and septic system were inspected prior to purchase and found to be in good condition but the home itself is in need of repair.  The property was initially purchased with the intention of selling the manufactured home and purchasing a modular home to be installed on the property.  At the same time I had the home I am currently living in on the real estate market.  My intention was to sell my home and use the proceeds to pay off debt and have cash on hand for emergencies.  By doing this and moving into a less expensive modular home (on the foreclosed property) I would be reducing my monthly mortgage payment as well as my total mortgage debt amount substantially.<br/><br/>I had a buyer lined up for the manufactured home but shortly before he purchased it there was a death in his family and he could no longer proceed with the purchase..... more to follow<br/> Borrower added on 11/04/10 > ...I began to feel that a new opportunity was presenting itself.  My current mortgage on that property is below $300. per month.  The mortgage is a land loan so I actually own the manufactured home outright.  If my husband and I were able to renovate the manufactured home ourselves we would be living in a nice home on a desirable piece of land for a very small monthly mortgage.  Really when you think about it, less than $300. per month is almost like living for free.  The renovation loan would be paid off relatively quickly (as compared with a mortgage) so in a few years our only debt would be a small mortgage and possibly a car payment.<br/><br/>I am a conservative spender.  In spite of this I have credit card debt.  My goal is to pay it off with the sale of my current house.  The reason for much of that debt is twofold.  My husband has had many health problems.  The cost of medical procedures and medications has been significant.  In addition, it has also resulted in gaps in his employment that have obviously resulted in less income.  He was also laid off from his job about 8 months ago after a massive downsizing (aobut 80% of his coworkers lost their jobs) in his department.  His health has improved greatly over the last few months and he has returned to school and is due to graduate in about 2 months.  I expect he will earn a reasonable salary once he graduates.  He has had 2 different employers approach him about a job after he graduates.<br/>",home_improvement,redneck repair,870xx,NM,12.86,1.0,Nov-1998,0.0,10.0,0.0,13815,22.6,32.0,0.0,Individual,0.0,0.0,Cash,0,0.3389921209219577,0.2998525234882649,0.3679922391195708,0.382796660257403,0.4982741835055009,3316

We did so with great happiness and excitement, dreaming the dream that all parents share: that we would be able to provide the best life for our child possible. <br/><br/>Currently I work for the county as an Assistant District Attorney, and I enjoy this job, but it is hard to make ends meet on my salary. As the sole breadwinner for my family, my current salary doesnât provide much beyond the basics, when you consider I am servicing a lot of credit card debt. I work hard to make sure we pay all of our bills regularly and on time, but it is hard to see an end to the credit card debt, especially when it seems I am paying more in finance charges than on the principal amount of the debt. <br/><br/>This credit card debt was acquired while I worked my way through law school and while my spouse and I renovated the modest farm house that we live in on our own. Even though we scrimped and saved while I was working through law school, and even though we invested our own sweat equity to make what was a virtually unlivable house into a homeâwe spent painting, plumbing, and hammering into the wee hours of the morning so that we could avoid having to pay someone else to do the workâI still racked up credit card debt just trying to make ends meet. <br/><br/>During law school, I often had to pay for groceries with my credit card, along with books and required class materials. One year, the engine in my 1995 Toyota Tercel died, and it had to be replaced because it was my only transportation to work, so I paid for the replacement with the credit card. During the year we renovated our house, which we had to do to help make sure the home was safe, I helped pay for many of the renovations to the home to make it livable with my credit cards. All of these times have come and gone, and I am still paying for these decisions, but I would like to be able to pay a more reasonable rate, get on a strong financial footing, and move into a new stage of my career where I can actually assist other people.<br/><br/>It has always been my dream to have my own practice where I could provide reasonably priced âcradle to grave,â legal services to folks who might not be able to afford other attorneys. <br/><br/>By investing in my loan, you can assist me to achieve my personal goals of providing properly for my family and getting on a sound financial footing so that I can move on to a stage in my  career where I can focus on the needs of other people. <br/><br/>Many thanks for your consideration!<br/> 571750 added on 11/11/09 > As an investor, you might ask, what makes me a good borrower?

We have one child in elementary school close to our current home and the other attends school where there is a program for children with Autism.  We plan to relocate closer to the school with the autism program and save over an hour commute each day and hundreds of dollars in gas money each month.  Additionally, we could save another $400-500 per month in rent from what we are currently paying now .<br/><br/><br/>The secondary reason for our loan request is when I applied with Lending Club for the moving loan, I was offered a larger loan at a lower interest rate than I am paying on most of my credit cards.  By paying off those high interest cards with a debt-elimination plan I should be able to raise my FICO scores even higher and actually save money with this new loan each month.  The entire cost of this new loan is lower than the monthly payments on the credit cards we will paying off.  This actually lowers our DTI ratio.  These two things are very important to us as we will plan to purchase a home within the next 2-3 years.  Saving money towards a down payment, keeping a high FICO score and lowering our DTI ratio is our plan to homeownership.<br/><br/>We have those high credit card interest rates because of an 8 year old bankruptcy I filed after my wife and I lost our high paying jobs in 2001 during the dot.com bust.  My wife was 6 months pregnant at the time of the double layoffs and our COBRA benefits were cancelled when her former employer ceased to exist as a business.  This happened one month before delivery and we were not covered by any insurance when the baby was born.  Bankruptcy was recommended to us by an attorney as a solution to our high medical debt.  It was a short term fix with long term consequences that cost us a lot over the years.  If ever I found myself in that kind of dire situation again, I would exhaust everything else before ever doing another bankruptcy.<br/><br/>I believe our loan is a great investment.   It&rsquo;s a win for us because we will be able to move closer to our young son&rsquo;s school and save hundreds of dollars each month.  It&rsquo;s a win for you because it&rsquo;s a high return on a low risk family.<br/> Borrower added on 07/20/10 > UPDATE:  LC's underwriter informed us that since we don't have any unsecured debt owed to a single creditor in the neighborhood of $16,000 the max amount they are letting us borrow is $6000.  In other words - we don't owe anyone else that much money (not including car loans, past mortgages, or past HELOCs).  I always thought that was a good thing, but I guess not here.<br/><br/>Disappointing?  You better believe it, especially since it really doesn't make sense.  Enough to cancel the loan that is currently funding at the higher loan amount interest rate?  No, we are grateful to those who have put their trust in us and have offered to fund our loan.  We will not disappoint you.  Moving closer to our 4 year old autistic son's school ASAP is our priority right now.  This loan will help accomplish that, and it will still save us hundreds of dollars in gas and premium rent that we are paying now.  In six months I will be able to re-apply for another Lending Club loan that will take care of the debt consolidation if that is something I still need to do at that time.  A perfect Lending Club payment history should go a long way towards softening the underwriters (We hope).

Many private vehicles- cars, mini-buses, motorcycles, bicycles etcâ¦ have been converted into taxis. The city of Kinshasa has a population of 9,000,000 people and there is a need to move 4,000,000 people on a daily basis. In Kinshasa the average load factor on large buses at the morning peak reaches 200 percent, with passengers hanging out of the bus or even sitting on the roof.<br/><br/>The urban transportation in the province of Kinshasa is mainly provided by two government owned corporations: City Train and STUC however, their fleet is limited. City Train has a total of 86 buses with a capacity to move 100,000 people. Due to its mismanagement, STUC active fleet has been reduced to 10 buses compared to 150 when it was first created in 2006. Both City Train and STUC are only able to move 120,000 people daily. According to a study by Ajay Kumar & Fanny Barrett, âStuck in Traffic: Urban Transport in Africaâ, the void in public transportation service is filled by private vehicles which account for 1200 minibuses. <br/><br/>The average family is able to afford no more than one daily round trip on the bus, while for the poorest households even this basic level of mobility is unattainable. But even this low rate of use translates into peak demand for around 200 seats per thousand residents, about five times higher than the supply available in any of the cities sampled.( Stuck in Traffic: Urban Transport in Africa, Ajay Kumar & Fanny Barrett)<br/><br/>To solve this problem, We have decided to enter this market by purchasing used school buses in the United States and used them for urban transportation in the city of Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of Congo)<br/>I will be the General Manager in this business.<br/>",small_business,Urban Transportation,750xx,TX,8.04,0.0,Nov-2005,1.0,7.0,0.0,14729,85.6,8.0,0.0,Individual,0.0,0.0,Cash,1,0.3835082487289872,0.4876877204451756,0.4256713486269152,0.3489412841684725,0.5140944624872413,2125

Our sewer tap is about a hundred yards from the house.  (That is not your typical sewer connection.)  The remainder of the loan would be used to spruce up the kitchen, bathrooms and family room.  We know from watching those home improvement shows that a small investment in improvement can return a larger reward when selling.  We have already made some home improvements such as a new roof, concrete work, outdoor painting, landscaping and electrical work.  If by some outside chance the home does not sell, that's ok.

So I took the job.  It was full time hours but only seasonal term.  I thought this was better than sitting home like a bum collecting state money.  Little did I know what headache taking this job would lead to. About a month into my new job , I received a letter from the unemployment office.  The letter stated that since I took this seasonal job it was assumed that I was never really looking for FULL TIME employment in the first place. So they now wanted me to pay them back the full amount I received while on unemployment in that time. I was confused because I thought I was doing the right thing by getting back out there and no longer taking the state money. So I fought this but in the end I lost. Fast forward to present day. I am now married and a father of a beautiful 2 year old boy. I am working full time for a Union contractor.

I would very much rather owe one institution/lender than several.  This way I could also save on my car insurance, by not having to have full-coverage.    Also, I do get paid cash but this has not affected my credit score since I have paid on time, not going to say always because there were two instances where I paid late, but not later than 15 days past the due date, and this was over a year.    I'm responsible and in no manner will I misuse the money.  I'm a college graduate, hence why I'm in debt, I used my credit cards for tuition, books, gas, meals, and supplies.  I don't want to damage my credit, so debt consolidation is out of the question, so is bankruptcy.  I don't believe in the easy way out, regardless the situation I made a conscious choice to use my credit cards even though it was for college.

I earn $76,000/yr as a systems engineer at an aerospace consulting firm and my wife is a realtor but she also has a teaching degree - she taught for 6 years, but she likes her new job more.  When our friends were buying homes we didn't think they could afford, we stayed in our apartment and paid of her 2002 Volkswagon car off and student loans, and almost all of mine.   I was promoted this year to the mid-level engineering position of senior-engineer and we both thought it was time to buy a house.  We waited until earlier this year to finally buy a house because we wanted to have only one car note and a small amount of student loan debt beore we were comfortable making the move.  We bought a 1979 $115k home in a nice neighborhood, I got a 5.0% rate, and our 30 year fixed plus insurance and tax is a mortgage payment of ~$950.  My wife wants to install new cabinetry in this older home, granite counter tops, and remodel the master bath.  What i would like to do is borrow here to update this house to the one she really wants.  We were both very responsible during the real estate boom, and we watched it bust from the sidelines aas we saw CDOs and ARMSs causing havoc to others.  What I'd like to do is reward ourselves in this way, knowing that with our responsible handling of finances, my recent promotion and dependable income, and with the money we didn't pay via an overpriced new home a loan of $25k is well within our budget.

I just sold the boat for $3200 on Ebay and I will be selling my truck that I used to tow the boat since I have no need for that. I should get around $4000 for that since it is a 1999 Chevy Silverado. I just did my taxes and my refund is $2600. With this money I will pay off the rest of my flight school loan and start a savings fund for a down payment on a house. I make $13 an hour as a maintenance supervisor and I go to school full time. I was in the Army and I am currently in the National Guard. The guard pays 100% tuition and my GI Bill pays me $1300 a month to go to school. I have 3 credit cards two are around $300 and one is at $1000. I live with my girlfriend and we split the rent and cell phone bill. My bills for the month are around $800.   With the money I will buy a motorcycle for under $10,000 and keep 1-2000 as another emergency fund. I already have $1000 set aside for emergencies. I figured it would be best to buy a motorcycle since insurance is cheap.  My credit rating has been in the low 700's and I want it as close to 800 as possible. I rather keep an installment loan to reach that score so I can save money on a mortgage some day.

If you check my credit history, as I just did, you will notice that I have not even 1 late payment on record. Also, I have not used credit recently for purchases. I borrowed a large amount of credit a few years ago, and am honestly tired of making multiple payments to multiple cards/accounts/lenders. I used a reputable credit simulation calculator, and the results showed that if I consolidated my accounts, my credit score would improve. You will also see that I am close to the max on most of my credit. That is because I have been paying down my cards, and every few months, the lender decreases my limit. I am fine with that, because I do not use credit anymore, but it makes my credit profile look bad. That is another reason why I am consolidating debt. If you look at my discover card, you will see that the original amount was 8,000 and is now paid down to 5,000. Over that time period, I have not charged anything to that card either. Discover is the only lender that has not gradually decreased my card limit. I have been at my current job for just 1 year, but have been in this line of work for almost 5 years. My job is extremely stable, as I am exceeding in every performance matrix we have, and am ranked in the top 5 out of almost 80 bankers in my region. The three accounts that I am consolidating with this loan have a minimum payment of about $300 a month combined, and I have never missed a payment. Subsequently, with this debt consolidation loan, I will have absolutely no trouble paying the minimum of about $200 a month. I actually plan on staying with the $300 a month I am used to, to pay the loan down faster.
