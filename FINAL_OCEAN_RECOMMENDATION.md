## Next Steps

1. Complete 05g_apply_elasticnet_to_full_data.ipynb
2. Complete 07_xgboost_comprehensive_comparison.ipynb
3. Return to this notebook for final recommendation

---

## Research Limitations

1. **MPNet Failure**: MPNet + ElasticNet completely failed (R2 ~0). Root cause unknown.
2. **Cross-Encoder Not Tested**: Route 3 (Cross-Encoder) methods not validated.
3. **Limited Ground Truth**: Only 500 samples used for training OCEAN models.
4. **Single Embedding Model**: Only tested BGE; other embeddings (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere) not explored.

---

## Alternative Research Directions

If OCEAN features are not valuable:

1. **Topic Modeling**: LDA, NMF on loan descriptions
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Financial sentiment, urgency detection
3. **Linguistic Features**: Readability, formality, deception detection
4. **Domain-Specific NER**: Extract financial entities (debt, income, goals)
5. **Behavior Prediction**: Predict payment behavior rather than personality

## Conclusion

PENDING - INSUFFICIENT DATA

The OCEAN personality feature extraction experiment has been completed for Routes 1 and 2A. 
Current results suggest OCEAN features may not be valuable for loan default prediction.
