# Ground Truth Status Report

## Current Situation üìä

### What Exists Now

**Files Present:**
- `ocean_ground_truth_500.csv` - 500 samples with OCEAN labels
- `ocean_features.csv` - Full dataset OCEAN features (123,088 rows)
- `ocean_weights_coefficients.csv` - Ridge regression weights

**Problem:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **All OCEAN values are currently 0.5 (default/unknown)**

```
OCEAN Score Distribution:
- openness: all 0.5 (no variation)
- conscientiousness: all 0.5
- extraversion: all 0.5
- agreeableness: all 0.5
- neuroticism: all 0.5

Ridge Regression Weights: All 0.0 (no learned patterns)
```

**Why?** The LLM generation likely failed or was not fully executed. Currently, the OCEAN features are placeholders.

## Historical Context üìú

### Two Approaches Were Planned

#### 1. OpenAI API Approach (in archive)
**File:** `archive_old_files/supervised_step1_label_ground_truth.py`

```python
# Method: Use OpenAI gpt-4o-mini to annotate ground truth
scorer = SimplifiedOceanScorer(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    offline_mode=False  # Use real API
)

# Cost: ~$1-3 USD
# Time: 10-20 minutes for 500 samples
# Quality: High (human-quality annotations)
```

**Approach Details:**
1. Sample 500 balanced loans (250 defaulted + 250 paid)
2. Call OpenAI API for each loan description
3. Get OCEAN personality scores (0-1 range) from gpt-4o-mini
4. Save as ground truth training set
5. Train Ridge regression to learn weights

**Status:** ‚ùå Not executed (archive shows it was proposed but not run)

#### 2. Hugging Face Llama 3 Approach (current)
**File:** `05a_llm_ocean_ground_truth.ipynb`

```python
# Method: Use Llama 3 via Hugging Face Inference API
client = InferenceClient(token=hf_token)

response = client.text_generation(
    prompt,
    model="meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct",
    max_new_tokens=200
)
```

**Approach Details:**
1. Sample 500 balanced loans
2. For each description, prompt Llama 3 to extract OCEAN scores
3. Parse JSON responses to get 5 personality scores
4. Save to `ocean_ground_truth_500.csv`

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially executed (notebook exists, but all scores are 0.5 = default value)

---

## What the Ground Truth Should Be üéØ

### Purpose
The ground truth serves as a **reference label set** to:
1. Train a Ridge regression model to learn OCEAN prediction weights
2. Map loan description text ‚Üí OCEAN personality scores
3. Validate the quality of OCEAN feature extraction
4. Understand which pre-loan features best predict OCEAN traits

### Requirements

**Ground Truth (500 samples):**
```
Sample 1:
  desc: "I'm looking to consolidate my credit card debt and start saving..."
  target: 0 (Fully Paid)
  openness: 0.65 (shows curiosity about financial management)
  conscientiousness: 0.78 (plans, mentions saving)
  extraversion: 0.45 (neutral tone)
  agreeableness: 0.50 (neutral)
  neuroticism: 0.35 (controlled, no stress language)

Sample 2:
  desc: "I worry about losing my job. Need emergency cash immediately..."
  target: 1 (Charged Off)
  openness: 0.40 (closed-minded, focused on immediate needs)
  conscientiousness: 0.30 (anxious, reactive, not planning)
  extraversion: 0.50 (neutral)
  agreeableness: 0.55 (mentions needing help)
  neuroticism: 0.80 (anxious, worried language)
```

## How to Generate Valid Ground Truth ‚úÖ

### Option 1: Use OpenAI API (RECOMMENDED)

**Pros:**
- High quality (GPT-4 class model)
- Fast (gpt-4o-mini is optimized)
- Reliable JSON parsing
- Cost: ~$1-2 for 500 samples
- Time: 5-10 minutes

**Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Set up API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'

# 2. Run the annotation script
python archive_old_files/supervised_step1_label_ground_truth.py

# 3. Outputs:
#    - ground_truth_ocean.csv (500 samples with OCEAN labels)
#    - Statistics and correlation analysis
```

**Cost Estimate:**
```
500 samples √ó ~0.002 USD/sample = ~$1 USD
(gpt-4o-mini is very cheap for text generation)
```

### Option 2: Use Hugging Face Llama 3 (FREE but Slower)

**Pros:**
- Free (no API costs)
- Open source model
- Faster once running

**Cons:**
- Slower inference (queue wait times)
- Less reliable JSON parsing
- Rate limiting issues
- Currently failing (all 0.5 values)

**Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Get HuggingFace token
# Visit: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
# Create read token

# 2. Set environment variable
export HF_TOKEN='hf_...'

# 3. Run notebook
# notebooks/05a_llm_ocean_ground_truth.ipynb
# (needs debugging - currently all scores are 0.5)
```

### Option 3: Manual Annotation (EXPENSIVE)

**Pros:**
- Highest quality
- Can correct LLM errors
- Better domain knowledge

**Cons:**
- Very expensive ($10-20+ per hour)
- Time consuming (500 samples = 40-80 hours)
- Not scalable

**Not Recommended** for this project at this stage.

## Recommended Action üöÄ

### Short Term (Get Results in 1 Day)

1. **Use OpenAI API** - Most practical
   - Cost: ~$1-2 USD
   - Time: 5-10 minutes
   - Quality: Excellent (GPT-4 class model)
   - Effort: Minimal (just run the script)

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'
python archive_old_files/supervised_step1_label_ground_truth.py
# This creates ground_truth_ocean.csv
```

2. Train Ridge regression with ground truth
3. Get OCEAN weights for all 123K samples
4. Use in models (04 & 06 notebooks already support this)

### Longer Term (Production Quality)

Once you have working OCEAN features:
1. Evaluate their predictive power in baseline models
2. If valuable, invest in higher quality ground truth (manual review of subset)
3. Consider fine-tuning OCEAN extraction on your specific loan data

## Current Data Flow Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

**What's wrong now:**

```
Current (Broken):
Raw Descriptions
     ‚Üì
Llama 3 (failing) ‚Üí All 0.5 default values
     ‚Üì
Ridge Regression (no learning) ‚Üí All weights = 0
     ‚Üì
Final OCEAN features (useless) ‚Üí All 0.5 for every sample
     ‚Üì
Models ‚Üí Can't benefit from OCEAN

Expected (Fixed):
Raw Descriptions
     ‚Üì
GPT-4o-mini (successful) ‚Üí Varied OCEAN scores (0.2-0.8)
     ‚Üì
Ridge Regression (learning) ‚Üí Meaningful weights
     ‚Üì
Final OCEAN features (useful) ‚Üí Diverse predictions (0.3-0.7)
     ‚Üì
Models ‚Üí Can use OCEAN for better predictions
```

## Quick Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Get OpenAI API Key
```
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api/keys
2. Create new secret key
3. Copy the key (sk-...)
```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variable
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'
```

### Step 3: Run Ground Truth Generation
```bash
cd /path/to/project
python archive_old_files/supervised_step1_label_ground_truth.py
```

### Step 4: Verify Output
```bash
# Check if ground_truth_ocean.csv was created

## Next Steps

**Immediate Action (Choose One):**

1. **RECOMMENDED**: Use OpenAI (cost: $2, time: 10 min)
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'
   python archive_old_files/supervised_step1_label_ground_truth.py
   ```

2. **Alternative**: Debug Llama 3 integration
   - Fix JSON parsing in notebook
   - Handle API rate limiting
   - Takes longer, but free

3. **Not recommended**: Proceed without proper ground truth
   - Models won't learn OCEAN patterns
   - Results will be meaningless (all 0.5 values)

**Document Status:** Current as of October 2024
**Recommendation:** Invest $2 in OpenAI API for clean, reliable results
