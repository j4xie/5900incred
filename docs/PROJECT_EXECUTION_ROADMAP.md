# Project Execution Roadmap

## **Phase 1: Data Preparation & Cleaning**

### Step 1.1: Initial Data Exploration
**Notebook:** `01_data_cleaning_with_desc.ipynb`
- Load raw loan dataset (2.26M records × 145 features)
- Analyze data structure and identify applicants with loan descriptions
- Data quality assessment and overview

### Step 1.2: Feature Selection & Leakage Prevention
**Notebook:** `02_feature_selection_and_leakage_check.ipynb`
- Identify and categorize all features
- Detect post-loan features that cause data leakage
- Remove metadata fields with no predictive value
- Assess feature coverage (eliminate <80% coverage)
- Create comprehensive leakage detection report

### Step 1.3: Create Clean Modeling Dataset
**Notebook:** `03_create_modeling_dataset.ipynb`
- **DELETE 109 features:**
  - 39 POST-LOAN features (prevents data leakage)
  - 3 METADATA features (no predictive value)
  - 67+ Low-quality features (coverage < 80%)
- **RETAIN 36 features:**
  - 19 numeric features (loan amount, income, credit metrics, etc.)
  - 15 categorical features (grade, purpose, employment, location, etc.)
  - 1 text feature (loan description for OCEAN extraction)
- Create binary target variable (Fully Paid vs. Charged Off)
- Output: Clean dataset (514,853 records × 36 features)

## **Phase 2: Feature Engineering**

### Step 2.1: Extract OCEAN Personality Traits
**Notebook:** `05_ocean_feature_extraction.ipynb`
- Parse applicants' loan descriptions
- Extract Big Five personality traits:
  - **O**penness: curiosity, preference for novelty
  - **C**onscientiousness: organization, discipline, planning
  - **E**xtraversion: sociability, assertiveness, energy
  - **A**greeableness: cooperation, empathy, kindness
  - **N**euroticism: anxiety, emotional instability
- Generate 5 new OCEAN features with confidence scores
- Merge OCEAN features with modeling dataset

---

## **Phase 3: Predictive Modeling**

### Step 3.1: Baseline Model (Without OCEAN)
**Notebook:** `04_xgboost_baseline.ipynb`
- Train XGBoost model on 36 original features only
- Establish performance baseline
- Metrics: AUC-ROC, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Feature importance analysis
- Identify top predictive features

### Step 3.2: Enhanced Model (With OCEAN Features)
**Notebook:** `06_xgboost_with_ocean.ipynb`
- Train XGBoost model on 36 original + 5 OCEAN features (41 total)
- Compare performance vs. baseline model
- Quantify OCEAN feature contribution
- Feature importance ranking for OCEAN traits

---

## **Phase 4: Results & Analysis**

### Step 4.1: Comprehensive Results Analysis
**Notebook:** `07_results_analysis.ipynb`
- Compare baseline vs. OCEAN-enhanced model
- Evaluate performance gains/losses
- Statistical significance testing
- Generate insights and business recommendations
- Create visualizations for stakeholder presentation

---
