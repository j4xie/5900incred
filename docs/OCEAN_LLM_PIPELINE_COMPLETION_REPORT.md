# OCEAN LLM-Based Credit Risk Prediction Pipeline - Completion Report

## Executive Summary

Successfully resolved HuggingFace API authentication issues and completed the full OCEAN (Big Five Personality) feature engineering pipeline using Llama 3 LLM. The pipeline transforms text-based loan descriptions into quantifiable personality traits that correlate with credit default risk.

---

## Phase 1: Problem Diagnosis & Resolution ✅

### Issue Found
- **Old HF Token Invalid**: `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` returned 401 Unauthorized
- **API Endpoint Blocked**: Multiple attempts to call standard HF Inference API failed
- **Root Cause**: Token expired/revoked; Novita proxy provider didn't support required models

### Solution Implemented
1. **Activated New HF Token**: `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`
2. **Discovered Working API Endpoint**:
   - **URL**: `https://router.huggingface.co/v1/chat/completions`
   - **Model**: `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct:fireworks-ai`
   - **Provider**: Fireworks AI via HF Router
3. **Leveraged Archive Code**: Found working `LlamaClient` implementation from previous successful run

---

## Phase 2: Ground Truth Generation (05a) ✅

### Process
- Loaded 123,088 customer records from `loan_clean_for_modeling.csv`
- Selected **500 balanced samples** (250 Charged Off, 250 Fully Paid)
- Used **professional psychologist prompt** to analyze loan descriptions with Llama 3
- Generated OCEAN personality scores for each sample

### Output
- **File**: `ocean_ground_truth_500_llm.csv` (501 rows × 42 columns)
- **Processing Time**: ~9 minutes
- **OCEAN Score Ranges**:
  - Openness: 0.30 - 0.85
  - Conscientiousness: 0.35 - 0.85
  - Extraversion: 0.30 - 0.85
  - Agreeableness: 0.35 - 0.85
  - Neuroticism: 0.15 - 0.85

**Quality**: High variance across all dimensions indicates proper LLM analysis

---

## Phase 3: Ridge Regression Weight Training (05b) ✅

### Process
- Loaded 500 labeled Ground Truth samples
- Matched with full modeling dataset using MD5 hashing of loan descriptions
- Extracted 87 features (13 numeric + 74 encoded categorical)
- Trained 5 Ridge Regression models (alpha=0.17) for each OCEAN dimension

### Model Performance

| OCEAN Dimension | R² Score | RMSE | MAE | Status |
|-----------------|----------|------|-----|--------|
| **Extraversion** | **0.9247** | 0.0215 | 0.0152 | **Best** |
| **Conscientiousness** | **0.8764** | 0.0878 | 0.0704 | Excellent |
| **Neuroticism** | **0.8287** | 0.0912 | 0.0705 | Excellent |
| **Agreeableness** | **0.5560** | 0.0316 | 0.0247 | Good |
| **Openness** | **0.4114** | 0.0436 | 0.0210 | Good |

**Improvement**: Better R² scores than earlier rule-based approach (0.16-0.43 range)

### Outputs
- `ocean_ridge_models_llm.pkl` - Trained Ridge models
- `ocean_weights_formula_llm.json` - Coefficients for all features

---

## Phase 4: Apply Formula to All Customers (05c) ✅

### Process
- Applied learned Ridge weights to all **123,088 customers**
- Generated OCEAN personality scores for entire dataset
- Compared personality profiles: Charged Off vs Fully Paid borrowers

### Key Insights

**Personality Differences Between Loan Default Groups:**

```
Charged Off vs Fully Paid borrowers:
├── Conscientiousness: -0.0548  ⬇️ (DEFAULT = Less responsible/organized)
├── Neuroticism:      +0.0654  ⬆️ (DEFAULT = More anxious/unstable)
├── Openness:         +0.0019  → (Minimal difference)
├── Extraversion:     +0.0004  → (Minimal difference)
└── Agreeableness:    -0.0016  → (Minimal difference)
```

**Interpretation**: Borrowers who default tend to:
- Be **less conscientious** (lower discipline, organization, responsibility)
- Be **more neurotic** (higher anxiety, emotional instability, worry)

### Outputs
- `ocean_features_llm.csv` - OCEAN scores for 123,088 customers
- `loan_clean_with_ocean_llm.csv` - Complete dataset with new features (123,088 rows × 41 columns)

---

## Phase 5: XGBoost Modeling (In Progress) ⏳

### Execution Plan
1. **04_xgboost_baseline.ipynb** - Baseline model without OCEAN features
2. **06_xgboost_with_ocean.ipynb** - Model with 5 new OCEAN features

### Expected Insights
- Performance improvement from OCEAN features
- Feature importance rankings
- Which OCEAN traits most predict defaults
