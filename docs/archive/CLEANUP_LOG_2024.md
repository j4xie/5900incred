# Project Cleanup Log - October 2024

## Overview
Comprehensive cleanup of outdated, duplicate, and unnecessary files from the project.

**Date:** October 26, 2024
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Space Saved:** ~74 MB (43% reduction)

---

## Summary of Changes

### Files Deleted: 13
### Space Released: ~74 MB
### Files Renamed: 5 (LLM versions → standard names)

---

## Phase 1: Old OCEAN Files (~72 MB)

### Why Deleted
These files contained placeholder values (all 0.5) from earlier attempts:
- Old `ocean_ground_truth_500.csv` - All OCEAN scores = 0.5 (no real data)
- Old `ocean_features.csv` - All features = 0.5 (placeholder)
- Old `ocean_weights_formula.json` - Incomplete weights

All were replaced by the LLM-generated versions with real data.

### Deleted Files
```
results/ocean_ground_truth_500.csv          126K   (placeholder data)
results/ocean_ground_truth_500.json         194K   (duplicate JSON)
results/ocean_features.csv                 2.3M   (placeholder data)
results/ocean_features.json                  12M   (redundant JSON)
results/ocean_weights_formula.json           13K   (old version)
results/loan_clean_with_ocean.csv            58M   (old version)
models/saved_models/ocean_ridge_models.pkl  8.8K   (old model)
```

### Retained Alternatives
✅ `results/ocean_ground_truth_500_llm.csv` → renamed to `ocean_ground_truth_500.csv`
✅ `results/ocean_features_llm.csv` → renamed to `ocean_features.csv`
✅ `results/ocean_weights_formula_llm.json` → renamed to `ocean_weights_formula.json`
✅ `results/loan_clean_with_ocean_llm.csv` → renamed to `loan_clean_with_ocean.csv`
✅ `models/saved_models/ocean_ridge_models_llm.pkl` → renamed to `ocean_ridge_models.pkl`

---

## Phase 2: Data Cleaning Temporary Files (~920 KB)

### Why Deleted
These were temporary analysis files from data preparation notebooks (01-03):
- Feature quality reports from initial exploration
- Data cleaning visualizations
- Intermediate analysis results

All insights from these files were documented in the final reports.

### Deleted Files
```
results/categorical_features_report.csv           1.7K   (temp analysis)
results/numeric_features_quality_report.csv       8.9K   (temp analysis)
results/data_cleaning_summary.png                364K    (old visualization)
results/data_quality_report.png                  542K    (old visualization)
```

---

## Phase 3: Artifacts Directory Cleanup (~1.5 MB)

### Why Deleted
- Old experiment results that were superseded
- Empty directories
- Duplicate model files from earlier runs

### Deleted Files
```
artifacts/ground_truth_llama.csv             252K    (old experiment)
artifacts/ocean_weights_llama.pkl              8K    (old experiment)
artifacts/xgb_ocean_llama.pkl                  1M    (old model)
artifacts/results/                           208K    (old results dir)
artifacts/persona_cache/                       0B    (empty)
```

### Retained
✅ `artifacts/persona_cache_simple/` (14M) - Kept for potential LLM re-runs

---

## Phase 4: Data Files Verification

### Decision: Retained All Data Files
After review, decided to **keep all data files** in `data/`:
- `loan.csv` (1.1G) - Original complete dataset
- `loan_clean_for_modeling.csv` (56M) - Primary clean dataset
- `loan_with_desc.csv` (98M) - Intermediate with descriptions
- `LC_loans_granting_model_dataset.csv` (160M) - Original source

**Reasoning:** Multiple versions support different use cases and provide data lineage.

---

## Phase 5: File Renaming (Standardization)

### Removed "_llm" Suffix
The "_llm" suffix was added to distinguish LLM-generated versions during development.
After deleting the old placeholder versions, these became the standard versions.

### Renamed Files
```
results/
  ocean_ground_truth_500_llm.csv      →  ocean_ground_truth_500.csv
  ocean_features_llm.csv              →  ocean_features.csv
  ocean_weights_formula_llm.json      →  ocean_weights_formula.json
  loan_clean_with_ocean_llm.csv       →  loan_clean_with_ocean.csv

models/saved_models/
  ocean_ridge_models_llm.pkl          →  ocean_ridge_models.pkl
```

## Results

### Space Savings

**Before Cleanup:**
```
results/        153 MB
models/         2.0 MB
artifacts/      15 MB
─────────────────────

```

**After Cleanup:**
```
results/        80 MB         (-73 MB)  ✅
models/         2.0 MB        (-8.8 KB) ✅
artifacts/      14 MB         (-1.5 MB) ✅
─────────────────────

## Impact Assessment

### ✅ Benefits
1. **Cleaner Repository:** Removed all outdated and placeholder files
2. **Reduced Clutter:** Results directory now contains only current, useful files
3. **Standardized Naming:** LLM files renamed to remove temporary naming convention
4. **Improved Organization:** Easier to understand which files are production-ready
5. **Space Efficiency:** 43% reduction in size for results and artifacts

### ✅ No Negative Impact
- **Data Integrity:** All important data retained
- **Model Availability:** All trained models preserved
- **Analysis Reproducibility:** All necessary files for re-running pipeline kept
- **Documentation:** All project documentation intact

## Recommendations

### For Future Cleanup
1. **Log Management:** Periodically clean `logs/` directory (keep only recent logs)
2. **Cache Management:** If LLM re-runs no longer needed, can delete `artifacts/persona_cache_simple/` (14M)
3. **Archive Old Notebooks:** As new notebooks are created, archive old versions in `archive_old_files/`

### For Maintenance
1. Keep this cleanup log for reference on what was removed and why
2. Apply similar cleanup principles when adding new results
3. Remove experimental/placeholder files immediately after creating production versions
