# Big Five (OCEAN) Personality Features - Simplified Demo
## Client Presentation Summary

**Date**: October 1, 2025
**Team**: Credibly INFO-5900 Gamma
**Approach**: Extract personality traits from **existing categorical features** (no free text needed)

---

## 🎯 What We Built

### Input: Existing Categorical Features (Already in Your Data)
```
✅ term                 → Loan term (36/60 months)
✅ grade                → Credit grade (A-G)
✅ sub_grade            → Sub-grade (A1, B2, etc.)
✅ emp_length           → Employment length
✅ home_ownership       → RENT/OWN/MORTGAGE
✅ verification_status  → Income verification
✅ purpose              → Loan purpose (debt consolidation, credit card, etc.)
✅ application_type     → Individual/Joint
```

### Output: 5 Personality Dimensions (0-1 scale)
- **Openness**: Innovation, risk-taking
- **Conscientiousness**: Responsibility, planning
- **Extraversion**: Sociability
- **Agreeableness**: Cooperation
- **Neuroticism**: Emotional stability

---

## 💡 Key Advantage: No Missing Data Problem

**Original Problem**: LendingClub dataset lacks borrower descriptions (`desc` field missing)

**Our Solution**: Build personality profile from categorical choices:
```
Example Borrower Profile:
"Loan Purpose: debt_consolidation | Loan Term: 60 months |
 Credit Grade: C (C4) | Employment Length: 5 years |
 Home Ownership: RENT | Income Verification: Verified |
 Application Type: Individual"
```

**LLM Prompt**: "Based on these choices, what personality traits are implied?"

## 🚀 Quick Demo

### Run This Now (2 minutes):
```bash
python3 quick_demo.py
```

**What It Shows**:
- 3 sample borrowers with different profiles
- OCEAN scores generated in real-time
- Visual bars showing personality dimensions
- Caching statistics

**Sample Output**:
```
Borrower 1 (Debt Consolidation, Grade C, Renter):
  openness            : 0.292 █████
  conscientiousness   : 0.750 ███████████████
  extraversion        : 0.750 ███████████████
  agreeableness       : 0.750 ███████████████
  neuroticism         : 0.348 ██████
```

## 📊 Full Pipeline Demo

### Jupyter Notebook (15-20 minutes):
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/03_ocean_simple_demo.ipynb
```

**What It Does**:
1. **Load 5k borrowers** from LendingClub data
2. **Generate OCEAN scores** for each (with caching)
3. **Visualize distributions** (5 histograms)
4. **Compare by default status**: Do defaulters have different personality profiles?
5. **Correlation with credit grade**: Does personality vary by risk level?
6. **Save enhanced dataset**: Original data + 5 OCEAN columns

**Expected Outputs**:
- 3 PNG charts saved to `artifacts/results/`
- Enhanced CSV with OCEAN features
- Stats: cache hits, API calls, processing time

## 🎬 Client Demo Script (10 min)

### Slide 1: Problem (2 min)
"Traditional credit models use financial data only. Recent research (Yu et al. 2023) shows personality adds predictive power."

### Slide 2: Our Innovation (2 min)
"We extract personality from **behavioral choices**, not text:
- Loan purpose choice → Openness
- Term length → Conscientiousness
- Joint vs solo application → Extraversion"

### Slide 3: Live Demo (3 min)
Run `quick_demo.py` and explain:
- "Input: 8 categorical features you already have"
- "Output: 5 personality dimensions in 0.1 seconds"
- "Cached results (no redundant computation)"

### Slide 4: Notebook Walkthrough (2 min)
Show `03_ocean_simple_demo.ipynb` results:
- Section 7: OCEAN distributions (show histogram image)
- Section 8: Default vs Non-default comparison (show bar chart)
- "Next step: A/B test in XGBoost model"

### Slide 5: Next Steps (1 min)
- ✅ Infrastructure ready
- 🔄 Run A/B comparison (Baseline vs Baseline+OCEAN)
- 📊 Measure ROC-AUC improvement
- 🚀 If promising: Enable API mode for real LLM scoring

## 🔧 Technical Details

### 1. How It Works

**Step 1**: Build profile string
```python
from text_features.personality_simple import build_borrower_profile

row = {
    "purpose": "debt_consolidation",
    "term": "60 months",
    "grade": "C",
    "sub_grade": "C4",
    "emp_length": "5 years",
    "home_ownership": "RENT",
    "verification_status": "Verified",
    "application_type": "Individual"
}

profile = build_borrower_profile(row)
# Output: "Loan Purpose: debt_consolidation | Loan Term: 60 months | ..."
```

**Step 2**: Score with LLM (or offline fallback)
```python
from text_features.personality_simple import SimplifiedOceanScorer

scorer = SimplifiedOceanScorer(offline_mode=True)  # No API needed
scores = scorer.score_row(row)

# Output:
# {
#   'openness': 0.292,
#   'conscientiousness': 0.750,
#   'extraversion': 0.750,
#   'agreeableness': 0.750,
#   'neuroticism': 0.348
# }
```

**Step 3**: Add to dataset
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("lendingclub_data.csv")
ocean_scores = scorer.score_batch(df)  # Auto-caches results
df[['openness', 'conscientiousness', ...]] = pd.DataFrame(ocean_scores)
```

### 2. Offline vs API Mode

| Mode | Speed | Cost | Quality |
|------|-------|------|---------|
| **Offline** | Instant | $0 | Deterministic (hash-based) |
| **API** | ~0.5s/row | ~$0.0003/row | LLM reasoning |

**For Demo**: Use offline mode (free, fast)
**For Production**: Enable API if A/B test shows improvement

### 3. Caching System

- **Key**: SHA256 hash of profile string
- **Storage**: JSON files in `artifacts/persona_cache_simple/{hash[:2]}/{hash}.json`
- **Benefit**: Re-running costs zero (even with API enabled)

**Example Cache Hit**:
```
Scoring 5000 samples...
  Progress: 100/5000 (2.0%)
  Progress: 200/5000 (4.0%)
  ...
Done! Stats: {'cache_hits': 4850, 'api_calls': 0, 'fallback_calls': 150}
```

## 📊 Success Criteria

**Minimum Viable Improvement** (at least 1 of):
- ROC-AUC: **+0.010** absolute increase
- PR-AUC: **+0.008** absolute increase
- KS: **+1.0** increase

**Interpretability**:
- ≥1 OCEAN dimension in Top 20 feature importance
- SHAP values show reasonable psychological directions

**Example Expected Pattern**:

## ❓ FAQ

**Q1: Why not use free text (`desc` field)?**
A: Dataset doesn't have it. This approach uses what exists.

**Q2: Is offline mode accurate?**
A: No - it's deterministic (for pipeline testing). API mode uses real LLM reasoning.

**Q3: How much will API mode cost?**
A: ~$0.0003 per borrower × 10k samples = ~$3 for full experiment.

**Q4: What if OCEAN doesn't improve model?**
A: We've validated the **technical pipeline**. Null result still valuable (documents what doesn't work).

**Q5: Can we use this in production?**
A: Only if A/B test shows statistically significant improvement + passes ethical review.
